# The Loneliness of Clarity - 1/6/2026

Clarity is often lonely.

Not because others are evil —
but because systems reward participation, not discernment.

Once you see how incentives actually work:

- conversations thin out
- applause quiets
- shortcuts stop tempting you

But clarity compounds quietly.
And in time, it builds things that noise never can.
