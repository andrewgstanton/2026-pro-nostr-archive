# Note — I’m Not Outside This - 2/5/2026

Everything I write about feeds, lenses, and agency applies to me first — and it’s something I wrestle with daily while building.


Just to be explicit:

I’m not writing *about* these tensions from a distance.  
I’m inside them.

Every time I touch Continuum — feeds, defaults, lenses, UX — I’m forced to choose between:
- simplicity and honesty  
- guidance and restraint  
- helping and overstepping  

None of this feels settled to me.

If anything, writing about agency makes building harder, not easier — because it removes shortcuts I could otherwise take.

So if a note sounds firm, that’s not because the struggle is over.  
It’s because I’m trying to name it clearly while still standing under it myself.
