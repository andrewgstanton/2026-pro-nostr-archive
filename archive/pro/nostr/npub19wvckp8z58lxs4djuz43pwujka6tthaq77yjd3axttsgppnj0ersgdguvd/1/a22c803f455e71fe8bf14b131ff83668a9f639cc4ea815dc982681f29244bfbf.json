  "content": "# A small but important change in Continuum.\n\nWhen I’m viewing someone’s npub, I can now save it locally as a read-only identity reference.\n\nNo private keys.\nNo signing.\nNo impersonation.\n\nIt’s not their identity — it’s my reference to it.\n\nThis matters because it shifts how discovery works. Instead of identities only existing in a scrolling feed, they can exist as durable, local references — the same way bookmarks, contacts, or citations do.\n\nYou’re not “holding” anyone’s identity.\nYou’re acknowledging that you encountered it — and that it mattered enough to keep track of.\n\nClear boundaries matter in sovereign systems:\n\nkeys are authority\n\nreferences are memory\n\nContinuum is deliberately separating the two.\n\n#nostr #identity #localFirst #digitalSovereignty #continuum",
