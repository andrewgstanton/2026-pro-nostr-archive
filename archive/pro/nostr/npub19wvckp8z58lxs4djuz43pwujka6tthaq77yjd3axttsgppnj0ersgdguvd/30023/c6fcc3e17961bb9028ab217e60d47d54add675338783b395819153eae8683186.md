Andrew G. Stanton - Jan. 3, 2026


I want to start with something clear and factual.

I have published **hundreds of long-form essays**—over five hundred at this point—using my own sovereign publishing system built on Continuum and Nostr. Long-form writing is not an experiment for me. It is the core of my work.

Substack is not where this began.

What follows is not a guide on how I *started* writing. It’s an explanation of how I am choosing to **distribute and coordinate an existing body of long-form work** across platforms—carefully, deliberately, and without losing integrity or burning out.

---

## Long-Form Comes First

My default mode of thinking and writing is long-form.

I write essays, series, and extended reflections because some ideas—especially around sovereignty, freedom, responsibility, and renewal—cannot be compressed into fragments without losing their meaning.

That work lives natively in:
- My own publishing stack
- My own archive
- Systems I control and can maintain long-term

This matters to me. Ownership, continuity, and permanence are not abstract values—they shape how and where I publish.

---

## Why Use Substack at All?

Substack is useful for one reason: **distribution**.

It offers:
- Email delivery to readers who want it
- A familiar interface for thoughtful long-form reading
- A way to reach people who are not yet using sovereign tools

What it does *not* offer is ownership, portability, or long-term guarantees. That’s fine—as long as those limits are acknowledged.

I don’t treat Substack as my canonical archive. I treat it as a **secondary surface** for work that already exists in fuller form elsewhere.

## Articles vs Notes (and Why the Distinction Matters)

Substack quietly operates two different systems:

- **Long-form posts** are publication-specific  
  They belong to a specific publication, follow its paid/free structure, and represent an editorial commitment.

- **Notes** are author-scoped  
  They function more like a public voice—orientation, context, signals, and invitations.

I use notes sparingly and intentionally. The vast majority of my output—historically and presently—is long-form.

Notes are not the work.  
They point to the work.

---

## Paid, Free, and Rhythm

Some of my long-form writing is paid. That is intentional.

Depth requires time. Time requires support.

For example:
- *The Bitcoin Chronicles* essays published during the week are paid
- Weekend writing is always free and set apart for Sabbath reflection, rest, and renewal

This isn’t about pressure or funnels. It’s about establishing a rhythm that honors both seriousness and generosity.

I don’t hide that structure. I name it once and let readers decide.

---

## Why I Still Write Sovereign-First

Platforms change. Policies shift. Tools disappear.

That’s why my primary commitment is not to a platform, but to:
- Clear thinking
- Durable archives
- Human-scale publishing
- Work that can outlast any single service

Substack is a useful bridge. It is not the foundation.

## Closing Thought

If you’re just starting to write, you don’t need a perfect system.

But if you plan to write for years—if you care about continuity, ownership, and freedom—you eventually need to think beyond any one platform.

That’s the posture I’m writing from.

Long-form first.  
Ownership first.  
Distribution as a choice—not a dependency.

If this approach is helpful, feel free to adapt it. Tools should serve the work, not define it.
