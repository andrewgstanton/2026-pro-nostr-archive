# Note 3 — Building Without Permission - 2/9/2026

There’s a strange freedom in building things no one asked for.

No roadmap pressure.
No audience optimization.
No need to justify why it exists.

Just the quiet question:
Is this correct?

Scripture

“Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men.” — Colossians 3:23
