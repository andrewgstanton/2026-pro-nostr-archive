  "content": "# Turned off WiFi - Continuum kept working\n\nSomething small but telling I noticed today.\n\nI turned off Wi-Fi entirely and kept working in Continuum.\n\nI could still write, edit, and revise drafts without interruption.  \nThe app didn’t lock me out or stop me from working — it just couldn’t reach relays when I tried to publish (as expected).\n\nThat contrast stood out to me.\n\nIf I only had a network-dependent client available, I would have been completely blocked the moment the internet disappeared.\n\nNot a critique — just an observation.\n\nLocal-first changes how software behaves when the world goes offline.",
