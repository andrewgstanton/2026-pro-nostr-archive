  "content": "# Note 5 — Restoration, Not Rebellion - 2/13/2026\n\nLocal-first is not rebellion for rebellion’s sake.\n\nIt is restoration.\n\nIt says:\nYour writing should not disappear.\nYour identity should not depend on a company’s terms of service.\nYour archive should not require permission.\n\nIt is not anti-technology.\nIt is pro-responsibility.\n\nThe irony is that sovereignty is not isolation —\nit is the foundation for genuine connection.\n\nWhen you own your keys, you can choose how to relate.\nWhen you control your data, you can choose how to share.\n\nFreedom makes communion possible.\n\n“For you were called to freedom, brothers. Only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another.”\n— Galatians 5:13\n\n#sovereignidentity #hope #buildforward",
