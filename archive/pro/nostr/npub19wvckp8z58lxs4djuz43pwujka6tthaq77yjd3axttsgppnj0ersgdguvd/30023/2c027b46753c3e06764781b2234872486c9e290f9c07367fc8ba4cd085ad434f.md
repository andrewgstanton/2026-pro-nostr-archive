# Continuum Bounty Test - MacOS

Continuum is a small, **local-first** tool for publishing profiles, notes, and long-form posts (articles) using Nostr.

Nothing runs in the cloud.  
No accounts. No sign-ups.  
Everything happens on your machine.

## What you need

- macOS  
- Docker Desktop  
  https://is.gd/KtiVeY
- Terminal access

## Step 1 – Unzip the package

Open Terminal and navigate to the folder where you unzipped the package:

```
cd ~/WHERE_YOU_UNZIPPED_PACKAGE/dashboard
```

## Step 2 - Ensure all scripts are executable (as a precaution)

From the dashboard directory, run:

```
chmod +x *.sh
```

## Step 3 – Verify platform

From the dashboard directory, run:

```
./verify_platform.sh
```

You should see:

linux/amd64

If you do, you’re good to continue.

## Step 4 – Clean and Build Container
From the dashboard directory, run:

```
./clean.sh
./build.sh
```

(The first build may take a few minutes.)

## Step 5 - Run Continuum
From the dashboard directory, run:

./run.sh
```

Then open your browser to:

```
http://localhost:5000/nostr/dashboard/
```

(First load may take a few seconds.)

⚠️ Bounty Requirement

To complete the bounty, **all three test sets must be completed**.

**TEST SET 3 is required.**
It validates Continuum’s read-only → signing identity flow and is not optional.

## TEST SET 3 – REQUIRED: Use an identity created from your own NPUB

This test is required because it exercises Continuum’s core sovereignty model:
view-only identities, explicit key ownership, and local signing.

### Step 1 - View another NPUB

In the Nostr Dashboard,

Click "View Another NPUB"
Enter your NPUB and click OK
(this will take a little while to refresh)

When page completes refreshing you should see a new section 
called "Currently Viewing" under the "Signing Identity" section.

### Step 2 - Create a new identity from your NPUB

Confirm your own NPUB is shown in the "Currently Viewing" section
Click "Save as Local Identity (Read-Only)"

This will create a new identity file using your display name 
or the npub. The new identity will have a suffix "_read_only" at the end of the identity.


### Step 3 - Edit your identity file

This step requires temporarily adding your `nsec` to a local identity file.
Nothing is uploaded, and no network calls include your private key.

Navigate to the directory:

dashboard/data/identities

in the unzipped package, using another terminal window or Finder.

Look for the identity file that was created. 

It will be a file ending with "_read_only.json"

Open the file 

Add your nsec so it matches the structure in default.json, for example:

Replacing the "nsec": null line
with your real nsec in the example below:

```
{
  "npub": "npub1...",
  "nsec": "nsec1...",
  "relays": [
    "wss://relay.damus.io",
    "wss://nos.lol",
    ....

  ]
}
```

Save the file and exit.

Restarting the container is not required.

### Step 4 - Select your identity file and run the same tests

In the Nostr Dashboard,

Click "Select Another Identity" 
and select your identity file created earlier with your npub in Step 2

Run through the same tests as in the first set:

- Update your profile 
- Publish, edit and delete a short article
- Publish, edit and delete a short note

## Feedback

- Was anything confusing?
- Did anything feel unnecessary?
- Where did you pause or hesitate?

Bounty submissions will only be reviewed if all three test sets are completed,
including TEST SET 3.

That’s it — thank you for testing Continuum!
