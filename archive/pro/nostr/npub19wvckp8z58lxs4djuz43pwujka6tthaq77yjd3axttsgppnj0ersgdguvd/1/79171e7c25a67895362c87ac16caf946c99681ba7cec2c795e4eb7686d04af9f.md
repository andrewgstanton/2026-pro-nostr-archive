# Note — “So What?” Is the Question That Matters - 2/5/2026

If something sounds obvious, the real question isn’t whether it’s true — it’s what it *forces you to do differently*.


When I write things like:
- “Nostr is neutral”
- “Clients aren’t”
- “Algorithms are editorial”

I realize some people probably think:  
**“Ok — so what?”**

That’s fair.

Here’s the *so what* for me:

These observations aren’t academic. They force concrete decisions every time I build.

They force me to decide:
* whether to rank at all  
* whether to default to chronology even when it’s less engaging  
* whether to hide complexity or surface it  
* whether to optimize for comfort or honesty  

And every choice has a cost.

Chronology costs engagement.  
Transparency costs simplicity.  
Agency costs convenience.

I still have to choose — every day — knowing there is no neutral option once you’re building a client.

So if something sounds obvious, that’s fine.  
The part that matters is what you do *after* you admit it.

For me, it means fewer shortcuts and more friction — by design.
