# Why Free Isn’t Neutral - 1/6/2026-

Free content isn’t neutral.

It trains both the writer and the reader to treat thought as disposable.

When everything is free:

- attention becomes shallow
- depth becomes optional
- authors become performers

Paying isn’t about exclusion. It’s about honoring weight.

Some things deserve to cost something — even if only a little.
