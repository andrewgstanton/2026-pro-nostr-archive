Bitcoin did not ask central banks for approval.

Nostr did not ask social media companies for blessing.

Faith does not ask culture for validation.

All three share something radical:

They operate from conviction, not consensus.

Sunday reminds us that authority does not always flow from institutions downward.

Sometimes it erupts upward.

The Kingdom grows like yeast — quietly, invisibly, inevitably.

So does protocol-level change.

If you are building something aligned with truth, you may not receive applause immediately.

But you do not need it.

The first day already declared the pattern:

Life wins.

Build accordingly.
