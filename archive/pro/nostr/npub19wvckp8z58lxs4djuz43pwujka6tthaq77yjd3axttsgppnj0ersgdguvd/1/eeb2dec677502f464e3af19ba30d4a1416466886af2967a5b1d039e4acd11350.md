📝 Note 3 — Integrity Over Metrics - 2/25/2026

Engagement is visible.
Integrity is invisible.

Platforms reward reaction.
Durability rewards discipline.

If you build for applause, you will adjust to the crowd.
If you build for integrity, you will adjust to principle.

One compounds faster.
The other lasts longer.

“The Lord sees not as man sees: man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart.”
— 1 Samuel 16:7
