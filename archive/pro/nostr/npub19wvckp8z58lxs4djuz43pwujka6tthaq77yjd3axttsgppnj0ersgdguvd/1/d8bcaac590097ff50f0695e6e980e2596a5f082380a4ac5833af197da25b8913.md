# Happy New Year 2026!!!

Happy New Year to all the creators, builders, and writers out there.

If 2025 was a year of unseen work, quiet discipline, or foundations laid without applause — you’re not alone.

May 2026 bring clarity, strength, and provision.
May the things you’re building with care find their moment.

Here’s to work that compounds,
fruit that comes in season,
and sovereignty made visible.
