# Note 3 — Sabbath Is a Rhythm, Not an Escape - 2/7/2026

Sabbath is not an escape from life.
It is a rhythm within it.

God did not abolish work.
He framed it.

Rest is what keeps work from becoming slavery.

> “Six days you shall labor… but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God.” — Exodus 20:9–10
