# Note 4 — Small Is Powerful - 2/13/2026

Local-first does not look impressive.

There are no glowing dashboards in the sky.
No billion-dollar valuations.
No endless venture rounds.

It looks like a folder.
A repo.
A clean SQLite database.

But seeds are small too.

The irony is that what is durable often begins quietly —
on a laptop, in a local directory, with a single identity file.

Faithful systems scale differently than hype.

“Do not despise these small beginnings, for the Lord rejoices to see the work begin.”
— Zechariah 4:10
