Stanton - Feb. 8, 2026\n\n---\n\nThe resurrection does not end the story.\n\nThis is easy to forget because Sunday is often treated as a conclusion — a moment of resolution that gathers the loose threads of suffering and ties them neatly together. In that framing, the empty tomb functions like a final page. The questions stop. The tension releases. The narrative closes.\n\nBut the earliest witnesses experience nothing like closure.\n\nThey arrive at the tomb expecting finality. What they encounter instead is absence, confusion, and instruction. The stone is rolled away, not to explain what has happened, but to expose that something irreversible has occurred.\n\n“Why do you seek the living among the dead?”\n\nThe question does not resolve uncertainty. It relocates it.\n\nThe resurrection does not give the disciples answers. It gives them responsibility.\n\nThis is a crucial distinction. Modern instincts tend to associate faith with clarity — with settled explanations and stable conclusions. Resurrection faith works differently. It does not remove ambiguity from life. It removes finality from it.\n\nWhat the disciples carry out of the tomb is not a blueprint for the future, but confidence about its author. They do not know how events will unfold. They know only that death has been interrupted, and that interruption changes the terms of everything that follows.\n\nThis is why the risen Christ does not say, “Understand this.”\n\nHe says, “Follow Me.”\n\nThe command is not anti-intellectual. It is directional. It does not ask for comprehension before commitment. It establishes allegiance in the absence of control.\n\nAfter Sunday, life does not become simpler. It becomes anchored.\n\nThe disciples do not emerge from the resurrection accounts as transformed heroes. They hesitate. They doubt. They scatter again. Resurrection does not erase their weakness. It entrusts them with witness anyway.\n\nThis is often overlooked.\n\nThe Christian story does not present resurrection as a mechanism that upgrades human capacity. It presents resurrection as an event that redefines reality and then sends fragile people back into it with a task they cannot fully manage.\n\n“Go and tell.”\n\nNot because they have mastered what has happened, but because silence would imply that the world has not changed.\n\nResurrection creates obligation.\n\nIf death no longer has the final word, then life can no longer be lived as though it does. Neutrality becomes impossible. Withdrawal becomes a form of denial. The future, having been reopened, now presses back on the present.\n\nThis is what resurrection demands.\n\nIt demands reentry into time rather than escape from it. It demands continued work rather than spiritual resolution. It demands faithfulness that persists even when outcomes remain hidden.\n\nAfter Sunday, the disciples return to ordinary settings — roads, meals, conversations, labor. The world does not suddenly glow with meaning. Roman authority remains intact. Injustice continues. Confusion persists.\n\nWhat has changed is not circumstance, but orientation.\n\nThe resurrection anchors time itself. It asserts that history is not drifting aimlessly toward decay, but moving toward restoration. That assertion does not accelerate the process. It stabilizes it.\n\nAnchoring is not control.\n\nAn anchor does not determine the route. It prevents drift. It holds position in conditions that would otherwise carry things away.\n\nResurrection functions in the same way. It does not grant mastery over the future. It prevents collapse into meaninglessness when the future resists visibility.\n\nThis is why resurrection demands patience.\n\nPatience is not passivity. It is endurance informed by direction. It is the willingness to continue without immediate confirmation, to labor without visible reward, to remain faithful without narrative payoff.\n\nAfter Sunday, the demand is not intensity. It is steadiness.\n\nThe resurrection does not ask people to live louder. It asks them to live longer — longer in truth, longer in love, longer in obedience that does not depend on applause.\n\nThis kind of life often appears unimpressive.\n\nIt does not trend well.  \nIt does not signal urgency.  \nIt does not offer spectacle.\n\nAnd yet, over time, it reshapes everything it touches.\n\nThe disciples eventually change the world not because they understood resurrection fully, but because they refused to live as though the tomb had remained sealed. They allowed resurrection to define their horizon even when it complicated their lives rather than simplifying them.\n\nThis is the demand resurrection places on those who come after them.\n\nNot certainty, but courage.  \nNot mastery, but allegiance.  \nNot resolution, but persistence.\n\nSunday does not conclude faith. It initiates it.\n\nIt sends people back into unfinished stories with the conviction that unfinished does not mean futile. That obedience counts even when results are deferred. That faithfulness is never invisible to God, even when it is ignored by history.\n\nAfter Sunday, life resumes — but not on the same terms.\n\nThe future has been reopened. Finality has been disrupted. Meaning is no longer hostage to outcome.\n\nThis does not make the road easy.\n\nIt makes the road walkable.\n\nAnd that is what resurrection ultimately demands: not escape from the world as it is, but faithful presence within it, sustained by the knowledge that the worst thing is no longer the last thing.",
