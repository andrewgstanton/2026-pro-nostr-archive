# Note 4 - 1/30/2026

4️⃣ Building feels slow when you’re pouring concrete.
It feels invisible.  Unshareable.

But when the storms come, no one asks how pretty the scaffolding was —
they ask what held.

Continuum is concrete work.
Clients are framing and paint.

Both matter. Order matters more.

“Steady plodding brings prosperity.” — Proverbs 21:5
