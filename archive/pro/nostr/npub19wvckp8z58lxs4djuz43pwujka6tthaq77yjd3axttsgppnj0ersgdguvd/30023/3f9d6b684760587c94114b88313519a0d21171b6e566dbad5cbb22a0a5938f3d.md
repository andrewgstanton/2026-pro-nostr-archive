Most platforms today are built to capture.

Capture attention.  
Capture data.  
Capture users.

Even well-intentioned builders can drift into this posture, because the surrounding ecosystem rewards it.

Blessing requires a different aim.

### Capture vs Care

Capture assumes users must be held.  
Care assumes users should be served.

A captured user cannot easily leave.  
A cared-for user could leave—but chooses not to.

The difference is subtle but profound.

### Designing for Dignity

Tools that bless others are designed with dignity in mind.

They do not hide exits, obscure ownership, or punish disengagement. Instead, they assume the user is capable and free.

This posture gives up leverage—but builds trust.

### Long-Term Trust

Trust compounds slowly but deeply.

A respected user becomes an advocate.  
A non-manipulated community becomes resilient.  
A clean tool becomes dependable.

These outcomes rarely show up in short-term analytics, but they shape long-term survival.

### Scripture Reflection

“Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others.” — Philippians 2:4
