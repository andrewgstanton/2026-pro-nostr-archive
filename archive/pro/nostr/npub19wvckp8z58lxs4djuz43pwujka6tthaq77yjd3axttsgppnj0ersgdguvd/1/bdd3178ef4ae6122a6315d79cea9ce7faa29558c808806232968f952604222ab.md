Do I need Pro?

No — not everyone does.
• If you mainly read notes and occasional free articles, you don’t need Pro.
• If you only want a specific paid article, 500 sats is enough.

Yes — Pro is likely for you if:
• you want long-term, unencrypted access to paid articles
• you want archiving without a recurring service fee
• you manage or plan to manage multiple npubs
• you want tools that don’t depend on third-party clients
• you value ownership and durability over subscriptions

Continuum is not a subscription platform.
It’s infrastructure and support for durable, sovereign publishing.
