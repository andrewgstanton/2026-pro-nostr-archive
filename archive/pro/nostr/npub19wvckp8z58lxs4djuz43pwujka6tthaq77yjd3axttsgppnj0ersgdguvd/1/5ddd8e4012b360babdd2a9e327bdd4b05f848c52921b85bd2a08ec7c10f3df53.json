  "content": "# Note 1 — We Had This Once - 2/13/2026\n\nThere is a strange irony in all of this.\n\nThirty or forty years ago, software was local by default.\nYour documents lived on your machine.\nYour credentials unlocked your device — not a remote server.\nYou bought a copy of something like Word or Quicken and it was yours.\n\nThen “the cloud” arrived — and convenience slowly replaced ownership.\n\nNow, in 2026, what feels radical is simply returning to what once was normal:\nrunning your own software, storing your own data, signing your own keys.\n\nLocal-first is not regression.\nIt is remembering.\n\nThe irony is that progress sometimes means recovering what we surrendered.\n\n“Thus says the Lord: Stand by the roads, and look, and ask for the ancient paths, where the good way is; and walk in it, and find rest for your souls.”\n— Jeremiah 6:16\n\n#localfirst #sovereignty #continuum",
