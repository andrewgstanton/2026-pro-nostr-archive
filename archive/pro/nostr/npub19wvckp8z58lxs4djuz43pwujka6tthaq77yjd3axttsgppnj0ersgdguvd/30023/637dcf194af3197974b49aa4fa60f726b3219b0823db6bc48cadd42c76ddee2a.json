Stanton - Jan. 3, 2026\n---\n\nThere is a kind of success that leaves you strangely undernourished.\n\nYou can be busy.  \nVisible.  \nEncouraged.  \nEven wealthy.\n\nAnd still feel hollow.\n\nI’ve noticed this feeling most sharply when consuming modern entrepreneurial and “guru” content — especially the endlessly motivational, reach-optimized strain that dominates platforms like LinkedIn, YouTube, and Instagram. It *works*. It produces energy. It produces motion.\n\nBut it rarely produces **formation**.\n\nI’ve come to think of this ecosystem as **fast-food capitalism**.\n\n---\n\n## Empty Calories, Real Profits\n\nFast food is not evil.  \nIt’s engineered.\n\nIt delivers:\n- quick energy  \n- instant gratification  \n- consistency at scale  \n- massive profitability  \n\nBut it is not designed to:\n- build strength  \n- sustain health  \n- cultivate patience  \n- nourish over time  \n\nFast-food capitalism works the same way.\n\nIt offers:\n- hustle without telos  \n- motivation without meaning  \n- reach without roots  \n- optimism without ontology  \n\nIt keeps people moving — but rarely asks *where* they are going, or *why*.\n\n---\n\n## The Optimization Trap\n\nMost modern business advice quietly assumes the system itself is good.\n\nThe questions it asks are tactical:\n- How do I get more attention?\n- How do I post more consistently?\n- How do I win this algorithm?\n- How do I grow faster?\n\nBut it avoids deeper questions:\n- What is worth optimizing?\n- What must not be optimized?\n- What should endure when incentives change?\n- What remains when the platform disappears?\n\nOptimization without values does not lead to fulfillment.  \nIt leads to acceleration — sometimes straight into a wall.\n\n---\n\n## Motion Is Not Meaning\n\nOne of the great confusions of our time is equating **motion** with **progress**.\n\nFast-food capitalism excels at:\n- velocity  \n- repetition  \n- volume  \n- stimulation  \n\nBut meaning requires:\n- coherence over time  \n- silence as well as speech  \n- cost, not just output  \n- work that stands even when no one is watching  \n\nThis is why so much motivational content feels strangely thin to people who are building slowly, faithfully, and at personal cost.\n\nIt is not that the advice is wrong.  \nIt is that it is **insufficient**.\n\n---\n\n## Why Some of Us Feel Repelled by It\n\nIf you are oriented toward:\n- permanence  \n- truth  \n- sovereignty  \n- work that compounds spiritually as well as economically  \n\nthen fast-food capitalism will eventually make you feel sick.\n\nNot angry.  \nNot jealous.  \nJust… empty.\n\nYour system recognizes malnutrition.\n\nYou are not hungry for more hacks.  \nYou are hungry for **weight**.\n\n---\n\n## Slow Food, Long Obedience\n\nThere is another way to build.\n\nSlower.  \nLess visible.  \nHarder to monetize quickly.  \n\nBut richer.\n\nIt values:\n- continuity over virality  \n- ownership over leverage  \n- archives over feeds  \n- cathedrals over billboards  \n\nIt does not scale cleanly.  \nIt does not fit neatly into slides.  \nIt rarely rewards its builders early.\n\nBut it feeds something deeper.\n\n---\n\n## A Final Clarity\n\nThis is not a rejection of success.\n\nIt is a refusal to confuse:\n- **signal with substance**\n- **reach with relevance**\n- **energy with nourishment**\n\nFast-food capitalism feeds momentum.\n\nBut some of us are building lives, systems, and works that must last longer than momentum ever does.\n\nAnd for that, we need real food.\n\n---\n\n*I am not anti-success.*  \n*I am anti-malnutrition.*",

      "Modern entrepreneurial culture excels at speed, reach, and motivation — but often at the cost of meaning, endurance, and truth. This essay explores “fast-food capitalism”: a system optimized for attention and momentum rather than nourishment, formation, or permanence — and why many builders increasingly feel empty inside it."
