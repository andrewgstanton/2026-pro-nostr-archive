# 2️⃣ Reach Is Not Strategy - 2/17/2026

More impressions ≠ more alignment.

Strategic marketing is not about broadcasting to everyone.

It’s about resonating with the right few.

Ten aligned builders matter more than ten thousand passive viewers.

Reach creates noise.
Resonance creates movement.

Choose depth over volume.

Scripture

“Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues with injustice.” — Proverbs 16:8
