  "content": "Hey Indie Hackers 👋\nMany teams are unfunded or underfunded — yet still need to ship real applications.\n\nEven technical founders hit the same limit:\n\n- building a full application alone is hard, even with AI tools\n- hiring requires cash\n- fundraising isn’t guaranteed\n\nStartNation helps startups build applications using a model called Hybrid-Source Development (HSD).\n\nHSD is an open-source-inspired, async development model where equity-aligned human builders use AI tools to ship applications — without significant upfront cash.\n\nWhat makes HSD work:\n\n- Async-first execution → work moves forward across time zones\n- Modular development → clear ownership, clean handoffs\n- Recognition + equity → contribution badges/honors + real ownership\n- Protected IP → critical modules stay private and controlled by the startup\n\nIf you’re building an application and capital is tight, we’re happy to chat.\n\n```\n- Andrew (andrewgstanton@gmail.com)\nPresident/Founder, StartNation\n```\n\n```\n- andrewgstanton \nposted to @IndieHackers on 1/12/2026\n```",
