Stanton - Feb. 8, 2026\n\n---\n\nSunday is often treated like a psychological convenience.\n\nA pause.  \nA breath.  \nA clean slate.\n\nWe speak of it as a reset — a chance to shake off the residue of the week, to re-center, to begin again. In that framing, Sunday becomes therapeutic. Useful. Gentle. Something like spiritual self-care.\n\nBut resurrection does not function as a reset.\n\nA reset implies erasure. Resurrection does not erase anything. It does not undo Friday. It does not pretend suffering never happened. It does not rewind the tape of history and try again with better conditions.\n\nThe Christian claim is far heavier than that.\n\nSunday is not God saying, “Let’s start over.”  \nIt is God saying, “This story is not finished.”\n\nThe resurrection of Christ does not remove the wounds of the crucifixion. The risen Christ is still wounded. The scars remain visible — not as evidence of failure, but as proof of continuity. Glory does not cancel suffering. It transfigures it.\n\nThis is why Sunday cannot be reduced to emotional uplift.\n\nIf resurrection were simply about comfort, the tomb would have been empty and silent. Instead, it becomes the most destabilizing site in history. The women arrive expecting finality. What they encounter is interruption.\n\n“Why do you seek the living among the dead?”\n\nIt is not a rebuke.  \nIt is a reorientation.\n\nThe question exposes a deeper assumption — that death is where stories end, that loss is definitive, that history closes with power and violence. Resurrection does not deny those forces. It refuses to grant them ultimate authority.\n\nModern life trains us to seek resets everywhere.\n\nWe reset devices.  \nWe reset schedules.  \nWe reset relationships by abandoning them.\n\nResets are efficient. They relieve us of the burden of continuity. They allow us to move forward without reckoning with what came before.\n\nResurrection offers no such relief.\n\nIt binds the past to the future and insists they remain in conversation. What was broken is not discarded. What was lost is not dismissed. What was endured is not meaningless.\n\nThis is why Sunday faith is heavier than optimism.\n\nOptimism assumes conditions will improve. Resurrection declares that meaning does not depend on conditions at all. Even death itself is no longer absolute.\n\nThat does not make life easier. It makes it more accountable.\n\nIf resurrection is true, despair is no longer neutral. It becomes incomplete — a failure to see reality as God has redefined it.\n\nSunday does not cancel Friday.  \nIt redeems it.\n\nResurrection is not an anesthetic.  \nIt is a compass.\n\nSunday does not make the week lighter.  \nIt makes it meaningful.",
