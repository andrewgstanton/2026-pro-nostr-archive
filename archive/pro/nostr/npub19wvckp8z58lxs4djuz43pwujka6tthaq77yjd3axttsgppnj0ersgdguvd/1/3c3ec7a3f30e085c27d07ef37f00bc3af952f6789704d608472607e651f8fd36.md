# Note 3 - 1/30/2026

3️⃣ I don’t use Continuum instead of clients.
I use it so clients don’t own my work, my history, or my identity.

That’s the quiet part most people miss.

The foundation doesn’t compete with the house —
it makes the house survivable.

“A wise man builds his house on the rock.” — Matthew 7:24
