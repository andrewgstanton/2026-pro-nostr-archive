  "content": "# ✏️ Notes are now editable in Continuum\n\nWhen you create a note in Continuum, it’s published with a d-tag by default — which means it can now be edited and republished cleanly, without deleting history or reposting noise.\n\nThis is a big step toward treating notes like documents, not disposable social posts.\n\nSmall feature. Big implications.\n\n(I just edited this note FYI -- this edit was added to the original note content above)\n\nALSO:\n\n- Continuum edits don’t change Nostr. They change the authoring layer.\n- Notes published with a d-tag become editable “documents” in Continuum. \n- Most clients won’t surface that.",
