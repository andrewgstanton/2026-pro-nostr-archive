# Note 5 — Restoration, Not Rebellion - 2/13/2026

Local-first is not rebellion for rebellion’s sake.

It is restoration.

It says:
Your writing should not disappear.
Your identity should not depend on a company’s terms of service.
Your archive should not require permission.

It is not anti-technology.
It is pro-responsibility.

The irony is that sovereignty is not isolation —
it is the foundation for genuine connection.

When you own your keys, you can choose how to relate.
When you control your data, you can choose how to share.

Freedom makes communion possible.

“For you were called to freedom, brothers. Only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another.”
— Galatians 5:13
