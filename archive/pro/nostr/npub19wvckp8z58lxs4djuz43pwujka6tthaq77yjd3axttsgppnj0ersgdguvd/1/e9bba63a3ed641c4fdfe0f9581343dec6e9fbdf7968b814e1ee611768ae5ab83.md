# Creation Requires Distance - 1/5/2026

Most people think creativity needs connection.

In truth, it needs distance — from noise, from reaction, from premature consensus.

Distance is where ideas gain shape.
Silence is where they gain weight.

This is as true for art as it was for early spacefaring cultures.
