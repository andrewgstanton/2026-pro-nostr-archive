# Sovereign Attribution Survey - Continuum

I’ve published an article outlining a small experiment I’m calling the **Sovereign Attribution Engine**.

It’s a request for *authored, signed responses* to a single prompt about local-first tools (Continuum), intentionally outside normal feed dynamics.

Details—including participation rules, a **1,000 sat acknowledgment**, and a **small response cap (up to 10)**—are in the article.

If intentional authorship resonates, please read there.
