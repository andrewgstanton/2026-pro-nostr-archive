Andrew G. Stanton - Feb. 2, 2026

I recently received a message that follows a pattern I’ve seen dozens of times over the years. The details vary, but the structure is always the same.

Stripped of names and pleasantries, the request looked roughly like this:

---

> **Income Opportunity: Daily Small Business Surveys**
>
> We are looking for select participants to take part in a multi-month research project.
>
> Compensation is offered per survey completed.  
> Surveys require 30–60 minutes and request high-quality, in-depth feedback.
>
> Participants must commit to completing surveys daily.
>
> If interested, please provide your phone number and email address to discuss next steps.

Nothing illegal. Nothing overtly deceptive.

And yet — everything important is missing.

## What Was Not Defined

The request did **not** specify:

- who owns the responses after submission  
- how the data would be used downstream  
- whether responses could be resold or repackaged  
- whether attribution was possible or prohibited  
- whether disqualification could occur after time was spent  
- whether contributors retained any reuse rights  

The phrase *“high-quality, in-depth feedback”* does a lot of work here — without committing to anything concrete in return.

This ambiguity is not accidental.  
It is structural.

## The Normal Outcome

In most cases, the expected flow is:

1. The participant invests time and cognition  
2. Responses are filtered, qualified, or discarded  
3. Accepted responses are absorbed into a dataset  
4. That dataset is monetized elsewhere  
5. The contributor exits with a small payment and no traceable authorship  

The insight lives on.  
The author disappears.

This is the default operating model of modern surveys.

## Reversing the Lens

Instead of asking, *“Should I participate?”*  
I asked a different question:

**Why is this the only model we’re offered?**

So I did the same thing the system does — I extracted the structure.

Not the person.  
Not the intent.  
The pattern.

And once you see the pattern clearly, the alternative becomes obvious.

## The Point of the Sovereign Attribution Engine

The Sovereign Attribution Engine was not written as a rebuttal to any individual message.

It was written because this pattern is everywhere:
- in surveys
- in research panels
- in feedback forms
- in “opportunities” that quietly centralize value

The article proposes a model where:
- contributors remain authors
- ownership is explicit
- consent is granular
- attribution is preserved
- aggregation is opt-in

Not because everyone will accept it.

But because **no alternative currently exists**.

## Playing the Game in Reverse

If organizations are comfortable extracting insight anonymously,  
they should also be comfortable having their extraction model examined openly.

No names.
No accusations.
Just structure.

This article is that mirror.

---

## Closing

I did not write the Sovereign Attribution Engine because I expect mass adoption.

I wrote it so that the next time someone says:

> “This is just how surveys work.”

There is a clear, documented response:

**They don’t have to.**

And now, they no longer get to pretend there is no other way.
