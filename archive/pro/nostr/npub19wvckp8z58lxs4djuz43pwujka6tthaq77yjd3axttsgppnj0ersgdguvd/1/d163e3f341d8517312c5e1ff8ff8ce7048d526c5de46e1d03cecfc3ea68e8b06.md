# Note 4 — Responsibility Is Freedom - 2/10/2026

Verse:

“Let each one test his own work.” — Galatians 6:4

Freedom is not merely the absence of restraint.

It is the presence of responsibility.

To speak freely
means you own your words.

To publish freely
means you stand behind what you create.

Sovereignty without responsibility
is just noise.

True freedom carries weight.

Scripture:

“To whom much was given, of him much will be required.” — Luke 12:48
