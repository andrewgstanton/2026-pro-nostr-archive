# Note 3 - 2/4/2026 - Durability Is an Ethical Choice

Building for the long term is not a technical preference — it’s a moral one.

 
Ephemeral systems externalize their costs to the future.

Durable systems absorb cost *now* so others don’t have to later.

That is not efficiency.  
That is ethics.

> “Build so that your absence does not erase your work.”

Scripture consistently honors what lasts.

> “The grass withers, the flower fades, but the word of our God will stand forever.”  
— Isaiah 40:8
