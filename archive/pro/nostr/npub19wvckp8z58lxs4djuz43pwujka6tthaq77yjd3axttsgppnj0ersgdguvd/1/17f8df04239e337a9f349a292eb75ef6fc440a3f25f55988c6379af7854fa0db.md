# Note 5 — Do Not Despise Small Beginnings - 2/10/2026

Verse:

“For who has despised the day of small things?” — Zechariah 4:10

Massive things often begin quietly.

A line of code.
A paragraph written.
A seed planted.
A habit repeated.

Small does not mean insignificant.

It means early.

Stay faithful in the early stage.

Growth belongs to God.

Scripture:

“One sows and another reaps.” — John 4:37
