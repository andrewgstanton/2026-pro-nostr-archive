Most new things are inconvenient.

They disrupt revenue streams.  
They expose fragility.  
They threaten incumbents.

So gatekeepers stall.

They request revisions.  
They demand proof.  
They ask for traction.

But resurrection did not file paperwork.

It did not ask Pilate for a statement.

New beginnings often look small.

A note.  
A repository.  
A USB image.  
A single npub.

But that is how movements begin.

Sunday is not loud.  
It is decisive.

You do not need permission to begin again.

And you do not need permission to build what you believe is right.
