# Note 4 - 2/4/2026 - Silence Is Still Feedback

When people don’t respond, they are often responding to the cost of deciding.
  
Silence doesn’t always mean disinterest.

Sometimes it means:

*  “If I engage, I might have to change.”
* “If I try this, I can’t unsee it.”
* “If this works, my excuses disappear.”

> “Avoidance is the last refuge of the undecided.”

That’s not condemnation.  
It’s human.

> “For whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin.”  
— James 4:17
