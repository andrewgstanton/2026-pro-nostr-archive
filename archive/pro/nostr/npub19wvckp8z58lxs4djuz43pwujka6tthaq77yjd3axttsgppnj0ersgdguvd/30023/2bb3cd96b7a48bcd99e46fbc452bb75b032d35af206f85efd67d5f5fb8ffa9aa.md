Resurrection is not polite.

Over time, it has been softened — wrapped in pastel language and seasonal metaphors. But at its core, resurrection is an act of resistance against the most entrenched assumption in human history: that death is final.

Not only biological death, but the death of meaning. The death of accountability. The death of hope.

Every system built on inevitability quietly depends on this belief. Resurrection refuses it.

This is why resurrection has always unsettled empires.

Empires can tolerate moral teaching. They can absorb spirituality. They can even accommodate suffering, so long as suffering remains futile. What they cannot tolerate is the claim that their power is provisional.

Resurrection declares that force is not ultimate. That time does not belong exclusively to decay. That violence does not get the last word. That the world is not closed.

This is not political resistance. It is ontological resistance — a refusal to accept the structure of reality as defined by fear and power.

Sunday embodies this refusal not through spectacle, but through persistence.

Week after week, the Church gathers not to generate momentum, but to remember orientation. To realign with a truth that contradicts inevitability.

The risen Christ does not return with armies or retribution. He returns with wounds and peace. Authority without coercion.

To live as a resurrection people is to live misaligned with the incentives of the age.

You will look impractical.  
You will look slow.  
You will look naïve.

Yet over time, this misalignment reshapes the world more deeply than spectacle ever could.

Resurrection does not deny the darkness.  
It refuses to grant it finality.
