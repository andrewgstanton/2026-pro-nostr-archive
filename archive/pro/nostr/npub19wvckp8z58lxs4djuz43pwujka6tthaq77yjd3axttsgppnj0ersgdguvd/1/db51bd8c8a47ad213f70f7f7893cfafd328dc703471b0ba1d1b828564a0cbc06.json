Choices do.\n\nSovereignty is not something you toggle on.\n\nIt is something you practice.\n\nIt looks boring from the outside:\n\n* owning your data  \n* understanding your tools  \n* accepting tradeoffs  \n* making decisions without social validation  \n\nMost people don’t reject sovereignty because it’s wrong.  \nThey reject it because it demands responsibility.\n\n> “Freedom is not the absence of constraints, but the acceptance of the right ones.”\n\nScripture doesn’t promise ease — it promises stewardship.\n\n> “Moreover, it is required of stewards that they be found faithful.”  \n— 1 Corinthians 4:2\n\n#continuum\n#sovereignty\n#agency\n#builders",
