# Continuum Protocols - 1/11/2026

This week I stopped treating relays as memory.

Not because they’re bad — but because they’re not designed to remember forever.

I’ve been working on a set of protocols that assume something different:

- databases can be wiped
- relays can forget
- backups can reappear
- deletion should still mean deletion

So the only thing that’s trusted is an archive and a manifest of intent.

It’s quiet work. Not client features. Not feeds.
But it’s the kind of work that makes everything else safer.

I published the full protocol write-up under the Continuum identity for anyone who wants to read it.

Relays are caches.
Archives are memory.
