# Note 3 — Rest Is Part of the System - 1/28/2026

Rest isn’t a reward for finishing —  
it’s a prerequisite for building anything that lasts.

Systems that never pause eventually collapse under their own weight.  
People do too.

Rest is not weakness. It’s calibration.

**“In returning and rest you shall be saved; in quietness and trust shall be your strength.”**  
— Isaiah 30:15
