# Note 1 — Sabbath Is a Confession - 2/7/2026

Sabbath is a confession before it is a command.

It confesses that I am not infinite.
That I am not essential.
That the world does not rest on my shoulders.

To stop is to admit the truth gladly,
not resentfully.

> “The Lord is God; it is he who made us, and we are his.” — Psalm 100:3
