# Note 3 — The Cost of Forgetting - 2/13/2026

We were told: “Don’t worry about storage. Don’t worry about backups. Don’t worry about architecture.”

So we forgot how systems work.

We forgot how to move our data.
We forgot how to migrate.
We forgot how to exit.

The irony of local-first is that it looks like complexity —
but it is actually clarity.

When your notes, articles, and archives sit in plain folders you can see,
you understand your system.

Visibility restores understanding.
Understanding restores agency.

And agency restores hope.

“The prudent sees danger and hides himself, but the simple go on and suffer for it.”
— Proverbs 27:12
