Sunday is often treated like a psychological convenience.

A pause.  
A breath.  
A clean slate.

We speak of it as a reset — a chance to shake off the residue of the week, to re-center, to begin again. In that framing, Sunday becomes therapeutic. Useful. Gentle. Something like spiritual self-care.

But resurrection does not function as a reset.

A reset implies erasure. Resurrection does not erase anything. It does not undo Friday. It does not pretend suffering never happened. It does not rewind the tape of history and try again with better conditions.

The Christian claim is far heavier than that.

Sunday is not God saying, “Let’s start over.”  
It is God saying, “This story is not finished.”

The resurrection of Christ does not remove the wounds of the crucifixion. The risen Christ is still wounded. The scars remain visible — not as evidence of failure, but as proof of continuity. Glory does not cancel suffering. It transfigures it.

This is why Sunday cannot be reduced to emotional uplift.

If resurrection were simply about comfort, the tomb would have been empty and silent. Instead, it becomes the most destabilizing site in history. The women arrive expecting finality. What they encounter is interruption.

“Why do you seek the living among the dead?”

It is not a rebuke.  
It is a reorientation.

The question exposes a deeper assumption — that death is where stories end, that loss is definitive, that history closes with power and violence. Resurrection does not deny those forces. It refuses to grant them ultimate authority.

Modern life trains us to seek resets everywhere.

We reset devices.  
We reset schedules.  
We reset relationships by abandoning them.

Resets are efficient. They relieve us of the burden of continuity. They allow us to move forward without reckoning with what came before.

Resurrection offers no such relief.

It binds the past to the future and insists they remain in conversation. What was broken is not discarded. What was lost is not dismissed. What was endured is not meaningless.

This is why Sunday faith is heavier than optimism.

Optimism assumes conditions will improve. Resurrection declares that meaning does not depend on conditions at all. Even death itself is no longer absolute.

That does not make life easier. It makes it more accountable.

If resurrection is true, despair is no longer neutral. It becomes incomplete — a failure to see reality as God has redefined it.

Sunday does not cancel Friday.  
It redeems it.

Resurrection is not an anesthetic.  
It is a compass.

Sunday does not make the week lighter.  
It makes it meaningful.
