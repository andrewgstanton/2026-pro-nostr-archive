  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - Dec. 31, 2025\n\nNew Year’s Eve is often treated like a starting gun.\n\nNoise.  \nCountdowns.  \nDeclarations shouted into the dark.\n\nBut this night is not a demand for momentum.  \nIt is a **threshold**.\n\nA thin place between what has been carried and what has not yet taken shape.\n\nThresholds are not crossed at speed.  \nThey are crossed with awareness.\n\nIf this year feels unresolved, that does not mean it failed.  \nVery few meaningful years end neatly.\n\nSome things matured quietly.  \nSome questions stayed open.  \nSome work continued without recognition.  \nSome losses did not obey the calendar.\n\nIf you feel the weight of that tonight, you are not behind.\n\nYou are *awake*.\n\nThe world often frames hope as enthusiasm.  \nBut real hope is calmer than that.\n\nReal hope says:  \n“I am still here.”  \n“I am still becoming.”  \n“I am not done.”\n\nYou do not need to reinvent yourself tonight.  \nYou do not need to justify what took longer than expected.\n\nThis moment does not ask for certainty.  \nIt asks for honesty.\n\nTo stand at a threshold is not to hesitate —  \nit is to honor what you are carrying forward.\n\nTomorrow will arrive whether you force it or not.\n\nWhen it does, it will not ask how loudly you celebrated —  \nonly whether you are willing to step forward intact.\n\nSo pause here for a moment.\n\nLet the year close without accusation.  \nLet the next one open without fear.\n\nThat is enough.",
