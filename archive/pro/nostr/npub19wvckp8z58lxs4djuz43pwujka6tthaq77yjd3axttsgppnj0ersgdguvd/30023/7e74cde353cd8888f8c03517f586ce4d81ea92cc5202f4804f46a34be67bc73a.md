The first witnesses of the resurrection did not leave the tomb with answers.

They left with a disturbance.

They arrived expecting finality. What they encountered instead was absence — and a question.

“Why do you seek the living among the dead?”

Resurrection does not hand the disciples a blueprint. It relocates uncertainty rather than removing it.

What they carry out of the tomb is not certainty about the future, but confidence about its author.

The risen Christ does not say, “Understand this.”  
He says, “Follow Me.”

Resurrection does not simplify life.  
It anchors it.

It anchors work that feels futile.  
It anchors obedience that goes unseen.  
It anchors love that is not returned.

The disciples do not become heroes overnight. They doubt. They scatter. Resurrection entrusts them with witness anyway.

“Go and tell.”

Not because they understand fully, but because reality has shifted.

Sunday does not conclude the narrative.  
It initiates the long obedience of hope.

Hope here is not a feeling. It is a discipline — a refusal to concede the future to decay.

We leave the tomb carrying questions, wounds, and responsibility — and the knowledge that life has already broken through the worst the world can offer.

That knowledge does not make the road easy.

It makes it worth walking.
