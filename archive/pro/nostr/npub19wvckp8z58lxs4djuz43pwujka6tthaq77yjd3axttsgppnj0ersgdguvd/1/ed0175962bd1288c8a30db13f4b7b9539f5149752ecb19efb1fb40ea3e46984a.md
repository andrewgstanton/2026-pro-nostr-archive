# Articles On Sovereignty !!

Over the past few weeks I compiled a set of **8 long-form paid essays** on Bitcoin as a civilizational system — focusing on honesty, responsibility, time, coordination, innovation through rules, and sovereignty. I published them tonight on Nostr.

For anyone who wants the **unlocked archive versions** or simply wants to support the work directly, I’m offering them at **500 sats** per essay.

No subscriptions. No platforms. Just finished work, shared peer-to-peer.

If useful, feel free to DM. Thank you.
