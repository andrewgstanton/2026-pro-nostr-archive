Before March 9th, just outline 3 buckets:

1️⃣ What Actually Happens When Teams Adopt AI

Tool enthusiasm vs workflow redesign

Governance + data concerns

Shadow AI usage

Productivity illusions vs real gains

2️⃣ Vendor Friction

Pricing unpredictability

Data boundary concerns

Integration complexity

Lack of process thinking

3️⃣ What Actually Works

Start with constrained use cases

Tie AI to measurable workflows

Treat it as augmentation, not replacement

Internal champions matter more than tooling

That’s more than enough.
