Stanton - Jan. 4, 2026\n\n---\n\nUrgency is persuasive.\n\nIt tells us:\n- now or never\n- move or miss out\n- act before it’s too late\n\nBut urgency is rarely the voice of renewal.\n\nIt is usually the voice of fear.\n\n### God Does Not Rush  \nScripture is remarkably unhurried.\n\nPromises unfold over decades.\nCallings mature over lifetimes.\nFruit appears in seasons, not moments.\n\nUrgency belongs to systems that fear collapse.\nRenewal belongs to a Kingdom that cannot be shaken.\n\n### Pressure Is Not Proof  \nWe often confuse pressure with importance.\n\n“If it feels heavy, it must matter.”\n“If it feels urgent, it must be right.”\n\nBut renewal often feels the opposite:\n- quieter\n- slower\n- steadier\n\nThe most meaningful changes rarely announce themselves loudly.\n\n### Faithfulness Over Acceleration  \nRenewal is not about speed.\nIt is about direction.\n\nA slow step in the right direction is infinitely more powerful than frantic motion in the wrong one.\n\nThis year does not need to be conquered.\nIt needs to be *walked*.\n\n### The Invitation of the First Sunday  \nThis Sunday is not a starting gun.\nIt is a clearing of the throat.\nA deep breath before speaking.\n\nYou are not behind.\nYou are not late.\nYou are not failing.\n\nRenewal is already at work—often long before you notice it.\n\nLet this year unfold.\nLet your work deepen.\nLet your life grow roots.\n\nUrgency can wait.\n\nRenewal cannot be forced.",
