  "content": "# Continuum Protocols - 1/11/2026\n\nThis week I stopped treating relays as memory.\n\nNot because they’re bad — but because they’re not designed to remember forever.\n\nI’ve been working on a set of protocols that assume something different:\n\n- databases can be wiped\n- relays can forget\n- backups can reappear\n- deletion should still mean deletion\n\nSo the only thing that’s trusted is an archive and a manifest of intent.\n\nIt’s quiet work. Not client features. Not feeds.\nBut it’s the kind of work that makes everything else safer.\n\nI published the full protocol write-up under the Continuum identity for anyone who wants to read it.\n\nRelays are caches.\nArchives are memory.\n\n#Bitcoin #Nostr #Sovereignty #LongTermThinking #Continuum",
