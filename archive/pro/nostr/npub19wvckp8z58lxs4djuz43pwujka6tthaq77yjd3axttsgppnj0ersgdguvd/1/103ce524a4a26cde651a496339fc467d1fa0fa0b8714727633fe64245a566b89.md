# 🚀 Note 3 — Volatility Means You’re Early - 2/11/2026

Verse:

“Be strong and courageous. Do not be frightened.” — Joshua 1:9

Stable systems rarely change the world.

Early systems wobble.

Bitcoin wobbles because it’s still being discovered.

That’s not a flaw.

That’s growth.

If everything felt calm and universally accepted, it wouldn’t be early anymore.

Scripture:

“For God gave us a spirit not of fear but of power and love and self-control.” — 2 Timothy 1:7
