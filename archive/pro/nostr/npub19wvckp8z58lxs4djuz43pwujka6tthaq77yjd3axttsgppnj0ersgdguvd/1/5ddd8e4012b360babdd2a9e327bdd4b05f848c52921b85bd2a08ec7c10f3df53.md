# Note 1 — We Had This Once - 2/13/2026

There is a strange irony in all of this.

Thirty or forty years ago, software was local by default.
Your documents lived on your machine.
Your credentials unlocked your device — not a remote server.
You bought a copy of something like Word or Quicken and it was yours.

Then “the cloud” arrived — and convenience slowly replaced ownership.

Now, in 2026, what feels radical is simply returning to what once was normal:
running your own software, storing your own data, signing your own keys.

Local-first is not regression.
It is remembering.

The irony is that progress sometimes means recovering what we surrendered.

“Thus says the Lord: Stand by the roads, and look, and ask for the ancient paths, where the good way is; and walk in it, and find rest for your souls.”
— Jeremiah 6:16
