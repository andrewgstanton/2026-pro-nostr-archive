# Note 1 — Build What Endures - 2/10/2026

Verse:

“Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.” — Matthew 7:24

There are faster ways to build.

There are louder ways to build.

There are more impressive ways to build.

But there is only one way that endures.

Foundations don’t trend.
They don’t get applause.
They just hold.

And when the storm comes, that is enough.

Scripture:

“The rain fell, the floods came, and the winds blew… yet it did not fall.” — Matthew 7:25
