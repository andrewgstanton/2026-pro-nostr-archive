# 🌱 Note 2 — Small Steps Compound - 2/11/2026

Verse:

“Do not despise these small beginnings.” — Zechariah 4:10

One note.
One article.
One block mined.
One line of code.

Small steps compound faster than dramatic gestures.

You don’t need a viral moment.

You need consistency.

And consistency is underrated.

Scripture:

“Whoever is faithful in little is faithful also in much.” — Luke 16:10
