# Continuum - Local First Publishing Clarification

Continuum runs locally on your own computer.
Your writing, keys, and signing stay local. No website. No login.

Publishing happens from the same program — it just sends a copy out. The original always stays with you.

Sovereignty here is about control of execution, data, and authorship — not ideological maximalism.

Mobile clients trade sovereignty for convenience. That’s a valid tradeoff.
Continuum makes a different one.

Use what fits your needs.

For clarity: I use Primal on my phone as well as Continuum. This isn’t an either/or.
