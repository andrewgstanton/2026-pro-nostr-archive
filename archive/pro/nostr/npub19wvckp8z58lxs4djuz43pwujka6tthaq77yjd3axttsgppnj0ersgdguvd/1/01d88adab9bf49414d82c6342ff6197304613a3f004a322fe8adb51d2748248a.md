# 🌊 Note 4 — Freedom Feels Good - 2/11/2026

Verse:

“For freedom Christ has set us free.” — Galatians 5:1

There is something deeply satisfying about holding your own keys.

About publishing without asking permission.

About building tools that don’t trap people.

Freedom is not just philosophical.

It feels good.

And joy is allowed.

Scripture:

“Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.” — 2 Corinthians 3:17
