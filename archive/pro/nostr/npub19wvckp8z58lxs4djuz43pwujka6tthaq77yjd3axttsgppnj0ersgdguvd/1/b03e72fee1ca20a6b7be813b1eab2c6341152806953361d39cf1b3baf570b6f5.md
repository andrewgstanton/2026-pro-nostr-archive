# Note 2 — Lenses Are Fine. Hidden Lenses Are Not - 2/5/2026

The problem isn’t bias. The problem is pretending there isn’t any.

Every interface is a lens.  
Every feed is a choice.

The ethical failure happens when systems say:  
“This is reality,”  
instead of:  
“This is *one way* of seeing.”

Give me lenses.  
Give me switches.  
Just don’t gaslight me.
