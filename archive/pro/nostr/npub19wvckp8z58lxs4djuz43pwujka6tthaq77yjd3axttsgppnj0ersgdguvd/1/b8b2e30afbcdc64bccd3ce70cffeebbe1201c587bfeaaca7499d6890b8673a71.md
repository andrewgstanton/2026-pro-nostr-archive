# Note 2 - 1/30/2026

2️⃣ Hawaii isn’t just Waikiki.
If you only stay at the hotel, you’ll think you’ve seen it — but you’ve missed the land.

Nostr isn’t just feeds and vibes.
If you only use clients, you’ve seen the shoreline — not ownership, not permanence, not agency.

Continuum lets you live there, not just vacation.

“You shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.” — John 8:32
