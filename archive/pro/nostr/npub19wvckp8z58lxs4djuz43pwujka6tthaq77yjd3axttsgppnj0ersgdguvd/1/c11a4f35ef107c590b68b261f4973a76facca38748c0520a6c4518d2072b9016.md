# Note 2 - When the Work Feels Heavy - 2/6/2026

**Verse:**  
> “Let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap, if we do not give up.” — Galatians 6:9

Weariness is not weakness.  
It’s often a sign that the work actually matters.

The temptation is to stop because nothing is happening.  
The truth is usually the opposite: something *is* happening — just underground.

Do not confuse fatigue with failure.

**Scripture:**  
> “Those who sow in tears shall reap with shouts of joy.” — Psalm 126:5
