Stanton - Feb. 15, 2026\n\n---\n\nBitcoin did not ask central banks for approval.\n\nNostr did not ask social media companies for blessing.\n\nFaith does not ask culture for validation.\n\nAll three share something radical:\n\nThey operate from conviction, not consensus.\n\nSunday reminds us that authority does not always flow from institutions downward.\n\nSometimes it erupts upward.\n\nThe Kingdom grows like yeast — quietly, invisibly, inevitably.\n\nSo does protocol-level change.\n\nIf you are building something aligned with truth, you may not receive applause immediately.\n\nBut you do not need it.\n\nThe first day already declared the pattern:\n\nLife wins.\n\nBuild accordingly.\n\n---\n\n**Scripture**\n\n> “The kingdom of God is like yeast…” — Luke 13:21  \n> “The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.” — Psalm 118:22",
