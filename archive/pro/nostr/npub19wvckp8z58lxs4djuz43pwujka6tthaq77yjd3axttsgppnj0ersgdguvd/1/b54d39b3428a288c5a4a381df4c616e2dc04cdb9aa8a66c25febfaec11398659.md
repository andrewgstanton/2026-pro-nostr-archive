# Note 1 - 1/31/2026

1️⃣ Resilience isn’t hype.
It’s quietly rebuilding after you’ve deleted everything…
…and watching it all come back because your archive is real.

Continuum taught me this:
if it survives a wipe, it deserves to exist.

“The wise man built his house on the rock.
The rain fell, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house,
but it did not fall.”
— Matthew 7:24–25
