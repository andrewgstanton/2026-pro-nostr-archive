Updated Feb 23, 2026

- Continuum runs entirely on your own computer.
- There is no cloud account.
- There is no hosted login.
- Your identity and your signing keys remain under your custody.

It is not a social media client.
It is a sovereignty layer beneath them.

## What Continuum Does

Continuum allows you to:

- Generate or import Nostr identities
- Write notes and long-form articles
- Send and receive secure messages (DMs) 
- Sign events locally with your private key
- Publish to relays when you choose

Archive everything deterministically on your machine

Signing and publishing are separate actions.

Your archive remains intact whether relays, clients, or platforms change.

## How It Works

- Install Continuum locally
- Create or import an identity
- Write content
- Sign locally

Publish to selected relays

Maintain a canonical local archive

Events propagate across Nostr clients — but your source of truth stays with you.

## Core Capabilities

- Multi-identity management
- Local key custody
- Sign-only and Sign+Publish workflows
- Long-form article publishing (kind:30023)
- Notes (kind:1)
- Delete support (kind:5)
- Encrypted direct messages (kind:4)
- Per-identity relay configuration
- SQLite-backed local database
- Deterministic export and rebuild

No subscriptions.
No vendor lock-in.
No dependency on a single relay or client.

## Who It’s For

Continuum is designed for:

- Writers and long-form creators
- Bitcoiners and sovereignty-minded builders
- Journalists
- Human rights advocates
- Ministries and mission-driven organizations
- Anyone who wants durable authorship

It is infrastructure for people who intend to keep their work.

## What It Is Not

- It is not a SaaS platform.
- It does not replace Nostr clients like Primal.
- It does not host your keys.

Continuum sits beneath the interface layer — providing custody, structure, and durability.

## Philosophy

Sovereignty is:

- Custody over identity
- Custody over work
- Separation of signing and publishing
- Structural exit
- Responsibility over convenience

Continuum is built on these principles.
