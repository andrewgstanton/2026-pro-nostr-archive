# RSS Feed in my archive - 1/19/2026

I’ve added a canonical RSS feed to my Nostr archive:

RSS (Articles):
https://nostr.mycontinuum.xyz/e/rss/npub19wvckp8z58lxs4djuz43pwujka6tthaq77yjd3axttsgppnj0ersgdguvd/kind/30023.xml

Not tied to any client.
Not dependent on relays.
Just a stable, self-hosted index of published work.

Nostr handles identity and signing.
RSS handles distribution.

It’s a small thing — but it changes how durable following can be.
