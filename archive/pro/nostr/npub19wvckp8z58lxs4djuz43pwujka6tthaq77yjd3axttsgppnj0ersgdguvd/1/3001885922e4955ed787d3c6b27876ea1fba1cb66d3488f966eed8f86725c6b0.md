# Note 2 — When Silence Isn’t Failure - 1/28/2026

Silence is often mistaken for rejection.  
But many important things grow underground first.

If your work still makes sense when no one is responding,  
you’re probably closer than you think.

Noise is optional. Direction is not.

**“You will hear a voice behind you, saying, ‘This is the way; walk in it.’”**  
— Isaiah 30:21
