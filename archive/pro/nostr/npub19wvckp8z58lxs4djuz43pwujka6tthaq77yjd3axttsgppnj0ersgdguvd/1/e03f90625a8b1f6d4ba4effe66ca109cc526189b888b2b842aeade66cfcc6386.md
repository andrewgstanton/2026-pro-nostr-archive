# 🌞 Note 1 — We Get to Build - 2/11/2026

Verse:

“This is the day that the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it.” — Psalm 118:24

We get to build.

We get to think.
We get to write.
We get to experiment with better systems.

That’s not burden.
That’s privilege.

The world isn’t ending.

It’s evolving — and we’re participating.

Scripture:

“The joy of the Lord is your strength.” — Nehemiah 8:10
