### Do I need Pro?

**No — not everyone does.**

- If you mainly read notes and occasional free articles, you don’t need Pro.  
- If you only want access to a specific paid article, 500 sats is enough.  

**Yes — Pro is likely for you if:**

- you want long-term, unencrypted access to all paid articles  
- you want archiving handled without a recurring service fee  
- you manage or plan to manage multiple `npub` identities  
- you want tools that work without relying on third-party clients  
- you prefer ownership and durability over subscriptions and platforms
