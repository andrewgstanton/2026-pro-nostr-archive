  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - Jan 1, 2026\n\nNot every year ends in flames.\n\nSome end in embers.\n\nBut embers are not the end of the story — they are the **middle**.\n\nAn ember is not what you celebrate.\nIt is what you *protect* so that celebration can still happen later.\n\nToo many messages to creators quietly imply this:\n“Just keep going.”\n“Don’t expect recognition.”\n“Be content without fruit.”\n\nThat is not wisdom.\nThat is discouragement dressed as virtue.\n\nPreservation is not the same as resignation.\n\nYou do not carry fire because you expect it to stay small forever.\nYou carry it because you believe it is meant to burn again — at the right time, in the right place, with the right conditions.\n\nSome seasons are about ignition.\nOthers are about *alignment*.\n\nMany creators, builders, and writers ended 2025 not empty-handed, but unfinished. The work is alive — yet constrained. The ideas are formed — yet not released. The systems exist — yet not fully inhabited.\n\nThat does not mean the fire failed.\nIt means the season demanded restraint.\n\nFire grows when it has room.\nWhen oxygen is present.\nWhen fuel is ready.\n\nAnd seasons change.\n\n2026 is not asking you to hide indefinitely.\nIt is asking you to **carry forward what is real so it can meet its moment**.\n\nThis may mean fewer declarations and more positioning.\nIt may mean pruning rather than expansion.\nIt may mean patience — but patience *with expectation*, not patience as surrender.\n\nFruit does not arrive the moment the seed is planted.\nBut neither does it remain underground forever.\n\nIf you have been faithful with what you were given —\nif you did not abandon the work,\nif you did not extinguish the fire out of despair,\nif you continued to tend it even while wondering when it would matter —\n\nthen you are not behind.\n\nYou are approaching a season where growth is possible.\n\nCarry the fire forward —\nnot because you expect nothing,\nbut because you expect **more**, and you are preparing for it.\n\nProtection is not the opposite of hope.\nIt is hope that knows timing matters.\n\nThis is not endless waiting.\nIt is the final stretch before emergence.",
