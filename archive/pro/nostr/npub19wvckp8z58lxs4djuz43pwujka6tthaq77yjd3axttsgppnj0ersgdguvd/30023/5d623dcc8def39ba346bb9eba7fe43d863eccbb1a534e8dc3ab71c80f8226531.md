Nearly every survey system in existence is designed around a single assumption:

**The respondent is an input. The organizer owns the output.**

This assumption is so normalized that it rarely gets questioned. Whether the survey pays $0, $5, or $50, the structure is almost always the same:

- Responses are submitted anonymously or pseudo-anonymously  
- Ownership transfers implicitly at submission  
- Downstream use is opaque or undefined  
- Responses are aggregated, resold, or monetized without attribution  
- Contributors retain no rights, no reuse, and no revocation

Even when the process is legal, it is still extractive.

The Sovereign Attribution Engine exists to break that model.

## The Core Reframe

A traditional survey asks questions.

A sovereign system **invites authored responses**.

Instead of treating people as data sources, the Sovereign Attribution Engine treats them as **authors issuing signed statements in response to a prompt**.

This is not a UX tweak. It is a power shift.

---

## Foundational Principles

### 1. The Responder Owns the Response

Responses are created, stored, and archived by the contributor — not the organizer.

They may live:
- locally
- in a personal archive
- or in a self-controlled publishing system

The organizer never becomes the default custodian.

---

### 2. Authorship Is Explicit and Verifiable

Each response is:
- signed by an identity (real-name or pseudonymous)
- cryptographically attributable
- verifiable long after publication

Insight has provenance.

---

### 3. Consent Is Explicit, Granular, and Revocable

There is no implied transfer of rights.

Each contributor explicitly grants permissions such as:
- aggregation
- anonymized analysis
- quotation with attribution
- time-bound reuse

Anything not granted is prohibited by default.

---

### 4. Responses Are Composable, Not Captive

A response is not locked into a single platform or project.

The same authored insight may:
- answer multiple prompts
- be reused by the contributor
- evolve over time
- be referenced rather than resubmitted

This respects the contributor’s time and cognition.

---

### 5. Aggregation Is Opt-In, Not Automatic

Organizers request inclusion.
Contributors grant it.

Aggregation becomes a **privilege**, not an entitlement.

---

## A Concrete Structure

### Prompt (Public, Minimal)
```
Prompt ID: SMB-OPS-2026-01
Question: What tools or practices do you rely on to manage operational risk?
Requested length: 300–600 words
Requested tags: #smb #operations #risk
```

### Response (Sovereign, Authored)
- Written as a note or article
- Signed by identity
- Stored by the author
- Tagged with the Prompt ID

### Grant (Explicit Consent)
```
I grant the organizer permission to:
✔ aggregate anonymized insights
✔ quote excerpts with attribution
✘ resell raw responses
✘ claim exclusivity
```

Nothing more. Nothing hidden.

## Why This Breaks the Survey Industry

The Sovereign Attribution Engine:
- eliminates qualification games
- removes incentive for low-effort answers
- prevents silent data reuse
- increases signal while reducing volume
- filters out organizations unwilling to respect contributors

Most companies will reject this model.

That is not a flaw.
That is the filter.

---

## Who This Is For

This system is not for:
- growth marketers
- quota-driven recruiters
- data brokers
- extractive research firms

It *is* for:
- independent researchers
- ethical journalists
- long-horizon organizations
- foundations
- historians
- builders who value authorship
- individuals who refuse anonymous extraction

---

## A Quiet Truth

People are not unwilling to share insight.

They are unwilling to be **stripped of agency** in the process.

The widespread exhaustion with forms, surveys, and identity capture is not apathy — it is withdrawal from systems that do not respect contributors.

The Sovereign Attribution Engine does not try to persuade everyone.

It exists so that when someone asks:

> “Is there a non-extractive way to ask people questions?”

The answer can finally be:

**Yes — but it requires respect.**

---

## Closing

This is not a platform.
Not a product.
Not a funnel.

It is a **pattern** — one that restores dignity, authorship, and consent to human insight.

Low adoption is expected.
Durability is the goal.

Some things are worth building even if only a few people ever use them.

Those few are enough.
