4️⃣ Freedom Serves Others - 2/24/2026

📖 Galatians 5:13

“For you were called to freedom, brothers. Only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another.”

Freedom is not isolation.

Paul moves immediately from liberty to service.

The pattern is:

Freed from sin

Freed from condemnation

Freed from fear

Therefore free to love

Freedom that does not produce love is not the freedom Paul describes.
