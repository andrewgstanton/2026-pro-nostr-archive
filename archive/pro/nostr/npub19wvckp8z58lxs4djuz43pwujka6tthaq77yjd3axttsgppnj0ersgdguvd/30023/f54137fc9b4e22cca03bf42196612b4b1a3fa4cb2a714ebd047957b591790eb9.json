Stanton - Feb. 15, 2026\n\n---\n\nThe first day did not ask Rome for permission.\n\nThe stone moved without a committee.\n\nResurrection is the ultimate unauthorized act.\n\nIt did not poll the crowd.  \nIt did not secure funding.  \nIt did not request validation.\n\nIt simply happened.\n\nAnd that is the pattern for sovereign builders.\n\nIf you wait for permission, you will wait forever.\n\nIf you wait for consensus, you will dilute conviction.\n\nSunday is a declaration:\n\nDeath does not have final authority.\n\nAnd in smaller ways, that applies to ideas too.\n\nIdeas that are ignored are not dead.  \nProjects without funding are not dead.  \nWork without applause is not dead.\n\nSometimes they are simply early.\n\nThe first day energy is quiet but unstoppable.\n\nYou wake up.\n\nYou build.\n\nYou publish.\n\nNot because someone asked you to.\n\nBecause you are called to.\n\n---\n\n**Scripture**\n\n> “Why do you seek the living among the dead? He is not here, but has risen.” — Luke 24:5–6  \n> “Behold, I am making all things new.” — Revelation 21:5",
