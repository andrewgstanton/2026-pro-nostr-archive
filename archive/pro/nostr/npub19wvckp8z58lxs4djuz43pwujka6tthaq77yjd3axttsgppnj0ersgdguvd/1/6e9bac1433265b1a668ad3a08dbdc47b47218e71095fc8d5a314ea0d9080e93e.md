# Note 5 - The Hidden Measure - 2/6/2026

**Verse:**  
> “Your Father who sees in secret will reward you.” — Matthew 6:6

Not everything visible is valuable.

There is a measure God uses that platforms never will:
truthfulness in secret.

If He sees it, it counts.

**Scripture:**  
> “The Lord sees not as man sees: man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart.” — 1 Samuel 16:7
