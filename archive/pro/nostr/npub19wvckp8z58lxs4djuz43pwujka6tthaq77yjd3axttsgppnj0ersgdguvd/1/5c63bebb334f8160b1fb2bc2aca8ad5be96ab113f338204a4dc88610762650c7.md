# Note 1 — Building When It’s Quiet - 2/9/2026

Building doesn’t always feel like momentum.
Sometimes it feels like repetition without applause.

Most durable things are built during those stretches.
Noise comes later — or not at all.

Either way, the work still counts.

Scripture

“Let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap, if we do not give up.” — Galatians 6:9
