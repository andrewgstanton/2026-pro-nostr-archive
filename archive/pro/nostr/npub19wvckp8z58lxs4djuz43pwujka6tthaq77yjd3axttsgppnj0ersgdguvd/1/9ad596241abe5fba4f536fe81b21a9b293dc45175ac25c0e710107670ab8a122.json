  "content": "# Note — I’m Not Outside This - 2/5/2026\n\nEverything I write about feeds, lenses, and agency applies to me first — and it’s something I wrestle with daily while building.\n\n\nJust to be explicit:\n\nI’m not writing *about* these tensions from a distance.  \nI’m inside them.\n\nEvery time I touch Continuum — feeds, defaults, lenses, UX — I’m forced to choose between:\n- simplicity and honesty  \n- guidance and restraint  \n- helping and overstepping  \n\nNone of this feels settled to me.\n\nIf anything, writing about agency makes building harder, not easier — because it removes shortcuts I could otherwise take.\n\nSo if a note sounds firm, that’s not because the struggle is over.  \nIt’s because I’m trying to name it clearly while still standing under it myself.\n\n\n#continuum #builders #agency #sovereignty #process",
