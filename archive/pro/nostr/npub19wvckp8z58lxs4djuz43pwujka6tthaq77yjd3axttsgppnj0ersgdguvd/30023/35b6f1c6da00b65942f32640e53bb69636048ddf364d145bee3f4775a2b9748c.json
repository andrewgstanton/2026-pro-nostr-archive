  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - Jan. 4, 2026\n\n---\n\nJanuary carries an unspoken demand:\n\n“Become someone better.”\n“Become someone stronger.”\n“Become someone more impressive.”\n\nBut renewal does not ask you to become someone else.\n\nIt asks you to become *more fully yourself*.\n\n### Renewal Is Subtraction, Not Addition  \nWe think change comes from adding:\n- more habits\n- more structure\n- more effort\n\nBut most renewal comes from letting go:\n- false expectations\n- borrowed ambitions\n- identities that were never ours to carry\n\nGrowth often feels like relief, not strain.\n\n### You Were Not Lost  \nYou don’t need to “find yourself.”\nYou were never missing.\n\nYou were buried under noise.\nUnder urgency.\nUnder comparison.\n\nRenewal is the quiet uncovering of what was always there.\n\n### The Grace of Continuity  \nThere is grace in continuity.\nIn faithfulness.\nIn remaining.\n\nThe pressure to reinvent is often a distraction from the deeper work of *remaining rooted*.\n\n> “Abide in Me.”\n\nNot restart.\nNot rebrand.\nNot outrun.\n\nAbide.\n\n### A Gentler Beginning  \nThis year does not require a dramatic entrance.\n\nIt requires honesty.\nPatience.\nPresence.\n\nYou do not have to become someone new in order to be renewed.\n\nYou only have to stop pretending you were never enough to begin with.",
