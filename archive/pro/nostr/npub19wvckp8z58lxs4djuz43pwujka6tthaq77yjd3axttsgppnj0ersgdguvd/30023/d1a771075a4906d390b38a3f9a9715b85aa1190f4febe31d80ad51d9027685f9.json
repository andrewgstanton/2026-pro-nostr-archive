  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - Jan. 23, 2026\n\n---\n\nBitcoin is not empowering in the way people expect.\n\nIt does not make life easier.\nIt does not reduce responsibility.\nIt does not protect you from yourself.\n\nIt does the opposite.\n\n---\n\n## The Infantilization of Modern Systems\n\nMost modern systems are designed to:\n- Absorb mistakes quietly\n- Hide consequences\n- Offer recovery without accountability\n\nThis creates convenience.\nIt also creates dependency.\n\nUsers are trained to assume someone else is responsible.\n\nBitcoin breaks this pattern immediately.\n\n---\n\n## Self-Custody Is Not a Feature\n\nSelf-custody is often marketed as a benefit.\n\nIn reality, it is a **burden**.\n\nIt requires:\n- Attention\n- Discipline\n- Care\n- Long-term thinking\n\nLose your keys, and the system does not negotiate.\n\nBitcoin does not infantilize its users by pretending otherwise.\n\n---\n\n## Why This Feels Hostile at First\n\nMany people encounter Bitcoin and conclude:\n“This is too stressful.”\n\nThey are not wrong.\n\nBitcoin removes the illusion of safety nets.\nIt exposes the reality that:\n- Risk cannot be eliminated\n- Responsibility cannot be outsourced\n- Freedom is inseparable from consequence\n\nThis is unsettling.\n\nIt is also clarifying.\n\n---\n\n## Maturity as a Prerequisite for Sovereignty\n\nBitcoin does not grant sovereignty.\nIt **requires it**.\n\nIt filters for people willing to:\n- Learn\n- Adapt\n- Accept fault\n- Improve operational discipline\n\nThis is not elitism.\nIt is necessity.\n\nA monetary system that cannot enforce responsibility collapses.\n\n---\n\n## The Unexpected Outcome\n\nSomething strange happens over time.\n\nUsers who stay:\n- Become calmer\n- Think longer-term\n- Take fewer reckless risks\n- Stop expecting rescue\n\nBitcoin reshapes behavior.\n\nNot through coercion.\nThrough structure.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBitcoin does not promise comfort.\n\nIt offers adulthood.\n\nIn a world optimized for perpetual adolescence,  \nthat may be its most revolutionary trait.",
