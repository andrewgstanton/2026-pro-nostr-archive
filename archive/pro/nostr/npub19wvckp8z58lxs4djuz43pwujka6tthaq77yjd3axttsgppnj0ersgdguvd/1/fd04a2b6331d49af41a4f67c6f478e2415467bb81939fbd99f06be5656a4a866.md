# When No One Is Watching

**Verse:**  
> “Moreover, it is required of stewards that they be found faithful.” — 1 Corinthians 4:2

Faithfulness is not measured by response.

Silence does not mean failure.  
Lack of affirmation does not mean disobedience.

Some work is done before witnesses arrive.  
Some seeds are planted in soil that stays quiet for a long time.

If you are faithful when no one knows,  
you are not late — and you are not forgotten.

**Scripture:**  
> “Be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain.” — 1 Corinthians 15:58
