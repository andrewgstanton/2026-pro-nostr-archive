The Rules That Do Not Bend

Continuum is not defined by features.
It is defined by constraints.

These are the rules that do not bend:

1️⃣ Private keys never leave local custody.
No hosted key layer.
No escrow.
No abstraction.

2️⃣ All content is signed locally.
Authorship is cryptographic, not cosmetic.

3️⃣ Signing and publishing are distinct acts.
Intention precedes distribution.

4️⃣ All primary data is hosted locally by default.
Custody and storage share the same trust boundary.

5️⃣ Local content must be retrievable in protocol-independent, client-independent archives.
Feeds are ephemeral.
Archives endure.

6️⃣ Creating and switching identities is a first-class activity.
Identity is not an account.
It is a sovereign unit.

7️⃣ Relays distribute. Clients render. Continuum preserves.
Distribution and presentation layers may change.
The durable layer does not.
