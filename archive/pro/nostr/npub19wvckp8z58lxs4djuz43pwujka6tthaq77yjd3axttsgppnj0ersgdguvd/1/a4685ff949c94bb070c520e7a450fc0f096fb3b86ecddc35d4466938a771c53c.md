# Cathedral Thinking - 1/6/2026

Most platforms are designed like pop-up shops.

- Fast.
- Disposable.
- Optimized for churn.

Cathedrals take longer.

- They don’t ask for constant attention.
- They assume future generations matter.

- I’m not building for virality.
- I’m building for continuity.

That changes everything.
