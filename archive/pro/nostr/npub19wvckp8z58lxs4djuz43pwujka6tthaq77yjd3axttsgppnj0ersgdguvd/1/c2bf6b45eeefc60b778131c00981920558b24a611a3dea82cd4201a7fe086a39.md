# Note 1 — Chronology Is Not Neutral, It’s Honest -2/5/2026

Chronological feeds don’t claim relevance, intelligence, or importance. They simply refuse to lie.

Pause.

If you’re scrolling, keep scrolling.
If you actually read this, reply **“read”** (public reply or DM).

Every ranking system encodes values, whether admitted or not.  
Chronology is the only ordering that doesn’t pretend otherwise.

It doesn’t tell you what matters.  
It tells you *what happened*, and lets you decide.

That restraint is rare.  
And increasingly necessary.
