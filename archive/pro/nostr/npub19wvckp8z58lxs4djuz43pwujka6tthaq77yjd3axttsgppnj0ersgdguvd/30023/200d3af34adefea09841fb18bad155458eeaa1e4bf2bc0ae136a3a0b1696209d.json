  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - Dec. 31. 2025\n\nEvery year leaves something behind.\n\nSometimes it leaves answers.  \nSometimes only lessons.  \nSometimes only endurance.\n\nIf you are ending this year tired, that does not mean you are empty.\n\nIt often means you have been **faithful without relief**.\n\nThere is a kind of strength that doesn’t announce itself.  \nIt doesn’t look like victory.  \nIt looks like staying.\n\nIn older cultures, fire was not endlessly re-lit.  \nIt was **carried**.\n\nSheltered from wind.  \nFed carefully.  \nPassed from hand to hand.\n\nThat is what this moment asks of us.\n\nNot to ignite something entirely new —  \nbut to protect what is already alive.\n\nA conviction that held.  \nA piece of work that endured.  \nA truth you refused to trade away.  \nA calling that remained, even when energy thinned.\n\nYou do not need the whole path illuminated.  \nYou only need enough light for the next step.\n\nThe coming year will bring its own demands.  \nBut what has been guarded with care is stronger than it looks.\n\nSo carry the fire forward.\n\nNot with urgency —  \nwith confidence.\n\n---\n\n**A Benediction for the Year Ahead**\n\nMay the ground before you open gently.  \nMay what you have guarded now begin to grow.  \nMay your patience be met with clarity, and your faith with provision.\n\nYou are not late.  \nYou are not forgotten.  \nAnd what you have carried was not in vain.\n\nCarry the fire forward —  \nand step into the year ahead with quiet strength.",
