# Note 1 — Resurrection Is Not an Escape - 2/8/2026

Resurrection is not an exit from the world.
It is God’s refusal to abandon it.

Sunday does not cancel Friday.
It redeems it.

Hope is not denial.
Hope is durability.

Verse:

“Why do you look for the living among the dead? He is not here; He has risen.” — Luke 24:5–6
