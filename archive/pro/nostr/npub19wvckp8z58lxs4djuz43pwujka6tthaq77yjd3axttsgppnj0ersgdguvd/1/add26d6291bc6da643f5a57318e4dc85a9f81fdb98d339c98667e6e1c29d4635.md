# Note 4 - 2/12/2026

Today reminded me that joy is not the absence of pressure.

It’s the presence of purpose inside it.

Pressure may remain.
Uncertainty may remain.
But so does calling.

And when calling remains, so does hope.

“Let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap, if we do not give up.” — Galatians 6:9
