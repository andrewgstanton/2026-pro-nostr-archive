Andrew G. Stanton - Jan 1, 2026

Not every year ends in flames.

Some end in embers.

But embers are not the end of the story — they are the **middle**.

An ember is not what you celebrate.
It is what you *protect* so that celebration can still happen later.

Too many messages to creators quietly imply this:
“Just keep going.”
“Don’t expect recognition.”
“Be content without fruit.”

That is not wisdom.
That is discouragement dressed as virtue.

Preservation is not the same as resignation.

You do not carry fire because you expect it to stay small forever.
You carry it because you believe it is meant to burn again — at the right time, in the right place, with the right conditions.

Some seasons are about ignition.
Others are about *alignment*.

Many creators, builders, and writers ended 2025 not empty-handed, but unfinished. The work is alive — yet constrained. The ideas are formed — yet not released. The systems exist — yet not fully inhabited.

That does not mean the fire failed.
It means the season demanded restraint.

Fire grows when it has room.
When oxygen is present.
When fuel is ready.

And seasons change.

2026 is not asking you to hide indefinitely.
It is asking you to **carry forward what is real so it can meet its moment**.

This may mean fewer declarations and more positioning.
It may mean pruning rather than expansion.
It may mean patience — but patience *with expectation*, not patience as surrender.

Fruit does not arrive the moment the seed is planted.
But neither does it remain underground forever.

If you have been faithful with what you were given —
if you did not abandon the work,
if you did not extinguish the fire out of despair,
if you continued to tend it even while wondering when it would matter —

then you are not behind.

You are approaching a season where growth is possible.

Carry the fire forward —
not because you expect nothing,
but because you expect **more**, and you are preparing for it.

Protection is not the opposite of hope.
It is hope that knows timing matters.

This is not endless waiting.
It is the final stretch before emergence.
