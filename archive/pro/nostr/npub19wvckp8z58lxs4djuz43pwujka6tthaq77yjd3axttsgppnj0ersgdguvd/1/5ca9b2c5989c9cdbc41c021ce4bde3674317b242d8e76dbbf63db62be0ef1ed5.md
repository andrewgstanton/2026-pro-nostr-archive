# The Water We Swim In - 1/6/2026

Most people don’t question the economic system they were born into.

Not because it’s good — but because it’s normal.

Scripture talks endlessly about idolatry, honesty, and justice.
Yet the modern monetary system — built on perpetual debt and quiet debasement — is rarely named.

Seeing the water doesn’t make you pure.
But refusing to see it guarantees blindness.
