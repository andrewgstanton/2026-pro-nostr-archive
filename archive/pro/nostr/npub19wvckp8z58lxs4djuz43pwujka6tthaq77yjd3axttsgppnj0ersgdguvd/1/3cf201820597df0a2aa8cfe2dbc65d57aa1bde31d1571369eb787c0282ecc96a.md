# Milestone - Continuum Running Elsewhere

Today marked a real milestone for me.

For the first time, someone other than myself was able to run Continuum on their own machine and actually use it.

This was done *outside* of any traditional Nostr client — although Continuum is, in essence, a client itself. There was no app store, no hosted platform, no account creation flow. Just local software running on someone else’s computer.

There was some startup friction (as expected, and now documented).  
The interaction UI is still rough in places.

But another human being was able to:
* update a profile,
* publish a note,
* publish an article,
* and then see that content show up across multiple independent Nostr clients.

That matters.

It means this isn’t just “working on my machine.”  
It means the core loop is real: **publish once → exist everywhere**, without being tied to a single app or platform, and running **entirely on your own machine.**

This is still early, still imperfect, still very much in progress — but today crossed an important line. 

I’m grateful for the patient tester, honest friction, and the reminder that real software only becomes real when someone else uses it.

One step at a time.
