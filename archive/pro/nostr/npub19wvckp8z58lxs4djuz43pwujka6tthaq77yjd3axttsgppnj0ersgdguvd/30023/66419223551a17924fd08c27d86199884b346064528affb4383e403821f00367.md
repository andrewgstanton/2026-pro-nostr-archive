Andrew G. Stanton - Dec. 31, 2025

New Year’s Eve is often treated like a starting gun.

Noise.  
Countdowns.  
Declarations shouted into the dark.

But this night is not a demand for momentum.  
It is a **threshold**.

A thin place between what has been carried and what has not yet taken shape.

Thresholds are not crossed at speed.  
They are crossed with awareness.

If this year feels unresolved, that does not mean it failed.  
Very few meaningful years end neatly.

Some things matured quietly.  
Some questions stayed open.  
Some work continued without recognition.  
Some losses did not obey the calendar.

If you feel the weight of that tonight, you are not behind.

You are *awake*.

The world often frames hope as enthusiasm.  
But real hope is calmer than that.

Real hope says:  
“I am still here.”  
“I am still becoming.”  
“I am not done.”

You do not need to reinvent yourself tonight.  
You do not need to justify what took longer than expected.

This moment does not ask for certainty.  
It asks for honesty.

To stand at a threshold is not to hesitate —  
it is to honor what you are carrying forward.

Tomorrow will arrive whether you force it or not.

When it does, it will not ask how loudly you celebrated —  
only whether you are willing to step forward intact.

So pause here for a moment.

Let the year close without accusation.  
Let the next one open without fear.

That is enough.
