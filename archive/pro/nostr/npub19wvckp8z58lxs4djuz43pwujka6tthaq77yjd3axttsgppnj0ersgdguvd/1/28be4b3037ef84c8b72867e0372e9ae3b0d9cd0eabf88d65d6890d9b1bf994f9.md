Note 1 — Infrastructure vs Surface - 2/19/2026

Software has layers.

Some tools are surfaces.
Some are substrates.

Surfaces are visible.
Substrates endure.

Confusing the two leads to bad architecture.

Continuum is not a surface platform.
It is an identity and custody layer.

The foundation is rarely visible — but without it, nothing stands.

“The wise man built his house upon the rock.” — Matthew 7:24
