  "content": "# Note — “So What?” Is the Question That Matters - 2/5/2026\n\nIf something sounds obvious, the real question isn’t whether it’s true — it’s what it *forces you to do differently*.\n\n\nWhen I write things like:\n- “Nostr is neutral”\n- “Clients aren’t”\n- “Algorithms are editorial”\n\nI realize some people probably think:  \n**“Ok — so what?”**\n\nThat’s fair.\n\nHere’s the *so what* for me:\n\nThese observations aren’t academic. They force concrete decisions every time I build.\n\nThey force me to decide:\n* whether to rank at all  \n* whether to default to chronology even when it’s less engaging  \n* whether to hide complexity or surface it  \n* whether to optimize for comfort or honesty  \n\nAnd every choice has a cost.\n\nChronology costs engagement.  \nTransparency costs simplicity.  \nAgency costs convenience.\n\nI still have to choose — every day — knowing there is no neutral option once you’re building a client.\n\nSo if something sounds obvious, that’s fine.  \nThe part that matters is what you do *after* you admit it.\n\nFor me, it means fewer shortcuts and more friction — by design.\n\n \n#continuum #nostr #clients #builders #agency #tradeoffs",
