The world teaches renewal as acceleration.

New year.
New goals.
New systems.
New momentum.

But Scripture teaches renewal as *return*.

> “Be still, and know that I am God.”  

The first movement of renewal is not action—it is *recognition*.

### Rest is Not Laziness  
Rest is alignment.

Rest is the act of laying down false weights:
- the need to prove
- the pressure to produce
- the fear of falling behind

When we rest, we declare—whether consciously or not—that the world does not depend on our constant output.

### Why the First Sunday Matters  
The first Sunday of the year is not about setting tone through intensity.
It is about setting tone through *orientation*.

Before the year asks anything of you, God asks one thing:

> “Come to Me.”

Not with plans.
Not with metrics.
Not with explanations.

Just come.

### Renewal Is a Gift, Not a Project  
You cannot engineer renewal.
You can only receive it.

Rest clears the noise.
Stillness recalibrates the heart.
Silence restores perspective.

This Sunday is not wasted time.
It is *foundation time*.

Renewal begins when we stop running long enough to be found.

And that is more than enough for today.
