Stanton - Feb. 1, 2026\n\n---\n\nStewardship is an unfashionable word.\n\nIt implies responsibility rather than ambition, care rather than conquest, limits rather than domination.\n\nYet stewardship may be the most accurate frame for intentional work.\n\n### Work Shapes People\n\nEvery artifact shapes its users.  \nTools influence habits.  \nSystems influence behavior.\n\nTo build without acknowledging this is to abdicate responsibility.\n\n### Resisting Exploitation\n\nExploitation often hides behind efficiency.\n\nStewardship asks harder questions:\n- What does this reward?\n- What does this normalize?\n- What kind of person does this train users to become?\n\nThese questions slow things down. That is their virtue.\n\n### Serving Without Mortgaging the Future\n\nMany systems extract value today by borrowing against tomorrow.\n\nStewardship refuses this trade. It seeks sustainability—technical, relational, and moral.\n\n### Faithful, Quiet Work\n\nStewarded work rarely shouts. It simply remains dependable.\n\nPeople return to it not because they are compelled, but because it keeps its promises.\n\n### Scripture Reflection\n\n“Moreover, it is required of stewards that they be found faithful.” — 1 Corinthians 4:2",
