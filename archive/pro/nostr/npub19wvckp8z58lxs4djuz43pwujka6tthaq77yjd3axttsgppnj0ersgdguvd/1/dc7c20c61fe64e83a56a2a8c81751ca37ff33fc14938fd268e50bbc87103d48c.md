# Turned off WiFi - Continuum kept working

Something small but telling I noticed today.

I turned off Wi-Fi entirely and kept working in Continuum.

I could still write, edit, and revise drafts without interruption.  
The app didn’t lock me out or stop me from working — it just couldn’t reach relays when I tried to publish (as expected).

That contrast stood out to me.

If I only had a network-dependent client available, I would have been completely blocked the moment the internet disappeared.

Not a critique — just an observation.

Local-first changes how software behaves when the world goes offline.
