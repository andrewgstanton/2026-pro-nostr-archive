# Note 3 - The Work of Waiting - 2/6/2026

**Verse:**  
> “The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness.” — 2 Peter 3:9

Waiting is not the absence of work.  
It is work done without visible progress.

What feels like delay is often formation.  
What feels unproductive is often preparatory.

Speed can build structures.  
Only patience builds people.

If you are waiting, you are not idle.  
You are being shaped.

**Scripture:**  
> “For still the vision awaits its appointed time… If it seems slow, wait for it; it will surely come; it will not delay.” — Habakkuk 2:3
