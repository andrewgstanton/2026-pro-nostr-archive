# Note 3 — Speed Is Not the Same as Strength - 2/10/2026

Verse:

“The plans of the diligent lead surely to abundance, but everyone who is hasty comes only to poverty.” — Proverbs 21:5

Moving fast can feel powerful.

But endurance is different.

Speed impresses.
Strength sustains.

If you are building slowly because you care about truth,
about control,
about durability—

that is not weakness.

That is discipline.

Scripture:

“Better a patient person than a warrior.” — Proverbs 16:32
