Do not be frightened.” — Joshua 1:9\n\nStable systems rarely change the world.\n\nEarly systems wobble.\n\nBitcoin wobbles because it’s still being discovered.\n\nThat’s not a flaw.\n\nThat’s growth.\n\nIf everything felt calm and universally accepted, it wouldn’t be early anymore.\n\nScripture:\n\n“For God gave us a spirit not of fear but of power and love and self-control.” — 2 Timothy 1:7\n\n#bitcoin #early #courage #innovation",
