**Note: Sovereign Authorship**

If my work is censored on platforms, I still have my archive.

If relays stop carrying it, the archive remains.

If even Nostr were to lose it, then something far larger has failed — not the work, and not the author.

Platforms are distribution layers.
Relays are transport.
Authorship lives at the source.

Publishing already happened.

Everything else is optional.
