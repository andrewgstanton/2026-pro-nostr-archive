Stanton - Feb. 15, 2026\n\n---\n\nMost new things are inconvenient.\n\nThey disrupt revenue streams.  \nThey expose fragility.  \nThey threaten incumbents.\n\nSo gatekeepers stall.\n\nThey request revisions.  \nThey demand proof.  \nThey ask for traction.\n\nBut resurrection did not file paperwork.\n\nIt did not ask Pilate for a statement.\n\nNew beginnings often look small.\n\nA note.  \nA repository.  \nA USB image.  \nA single npub.\n\nBut that is how movements begin.\n\nSunday is not loud.  \nIt is decisive.\n\nYou do not need permission to begin again.\n\nAnd you do not need permission to build what you believe is right.\n\n---\n\n**Scripture**\n\n> “This is the day that the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it.” — Psalm 118:24  \n> “Forget the former things… see, I am doing a new thing!” — Isaiah 43:18–19",
