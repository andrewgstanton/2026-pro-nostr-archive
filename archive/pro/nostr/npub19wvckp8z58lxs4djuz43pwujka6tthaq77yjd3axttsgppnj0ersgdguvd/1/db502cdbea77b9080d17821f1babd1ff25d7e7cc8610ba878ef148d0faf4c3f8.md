# Note 4 — Building as Refusal - 2/9/2026

Sometimes building isn’t ambition.
It’s refusal.

Refusal to let convenience erase responsibility.
Refusal to let speed replace care.
Refusal to let systems decide for you.

You build because not building would cost more.

Scripture

“We must obey God rather than men.” — Acts 5:29
