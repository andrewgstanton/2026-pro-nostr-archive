# Continuum Archiving Service

I don’t fault relays for pruning — they have to manage storage and performance.

But the practical reality is this: if you publish long-form on Nostr and do not maintain your own archive (or pay for a premium service), your older history will eventually become unreachable. I confirmed this firsthand — older kind:30023 articles are already gone from relays.

Relays optimize for distribution, not permanence. Decentralization does not automatically mean durability.

Because I care about long-term publishing, I archive entire Nostr identities by **npub only**.

**Example (same npub):**

• Archive (full history, permanent):  
https://is.gd/qcfwez

• Primal view (app-dependent history):  
https://is.gd/re7SvU  
*(I’m a Primal Premium user — without premium or an external archive, even less history is typically retrievable.)*

**What I archive (public, permanent):**
- kind:0 (profile)
- kind:1 (notes)
- kind:5 (deletions / tombstones)
- kind:30023 (long-form articles)
- soon: kind:4 (DMs to self)

**Concrete example for me:** 

```
This article was published on [12/23/2025]. 
It is no longer retrievable from relays in standard clients, 
but it is preserved in my archive (and in Primal Premium, since I’m a subscriber). 
Without an archive or paid retention, it would effectively be gone.
```

- **article in my archive:** https://is.gd/V1uogt

- **article on primal:** https://is.gd/to41mq


Archived links are **permanent and publicly accessible**.  
If you stop paying, your archive freezes — nothing is deleted.

**Cost:** 5,000 sats / month  
**Required:** your npub only (no account, no login, no app)

If you publish long-form and want your history to outlive relay pruning, **DM me**.
