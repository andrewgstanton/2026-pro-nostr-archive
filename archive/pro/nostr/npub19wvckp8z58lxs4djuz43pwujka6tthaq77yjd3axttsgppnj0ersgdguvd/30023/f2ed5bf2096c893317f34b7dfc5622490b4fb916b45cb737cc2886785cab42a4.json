Stanton - Jan. 17, 2026\n\nThere’s a certain kind of peace that comes from knowing where your work is.\n\nNot where it’s posted.  \nNot where it’s promoted.  \nWhere it actually lives.\n\nThe good news is that reclaiming that feeling doesn’t require big moves or dramatic overhauls. It usually starts with small, unglamorous habits — the kind no one posts screenshots of.\n\nHere are a few that have helped me.\n\nFirst: save originals.\n\nNot drafts buried in an app. Actual files. Text, images, notes — kept somewhere you understand. The goal isn’t control. It’s reassurance. Knowing that if everything else vanished, your work wouldn’t.\n\nSecond: write before you publish.\n\nThis sounds obvious, but it’s easy to reverse. When you write directly into a platform, your thinking subtly adapts to it. Writing elsewhere first gives ideas a chance to form without being watched.\n\nThird: keep one folder that makes sense to *you*.\n\nNot perfectly organized. Just understandable. Something you could explain to yourself six months from now without sighing.\n\nFourth: name files like they matter.\n\n“final_v7_really_final” is funny, but also a small form of chaos. Clear names are a quiet kindness to your future self.\n\nFifth: separate identity from output.\n\nYour account is not your work. Your profile is not your archive. Remembering this makes everything feel lighter.\n\nNone of these habits are impressive. That’s the point.\n\nThey don’t optimize reach.  \nThey don’t increase engagement.  \nThey don’t look productive.\n\nBut they do something else.\n\nThey reduce friction.  \nThey lower anxiety.  \nThey make the work feel settled.\n\nOver time, these small choices add up. You stop feeling rushed. You stop feeling dependent. You stop worrying quite so much about where things are going.\n\nThe work feels like it has a home.\n\nAnd once it does, sharing it becomes easier — because you’re no longer afraid of losing it.",
