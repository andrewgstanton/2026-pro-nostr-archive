Stanton - Feb. 8, 2026\n\n---\n\nSunday is often treated like a psychological convenience.\n\nA pause.\nA breath.\nA clean slate.\n\nThe language we use reveals the expectation: the week accumulates weight, Sunday clears it. We imagine the day functioning like a reset button — something that wipes the slate clean so that Monday can begin without residue. In this framing, Sunday becomes therapeutic. Useful. Gentle. A form of spiritual recovery.\n\nThere is truth in the instinct. Rest matters. Reorientation matters. But resurrection does not operate as a reset, and treating it that way quietly distorts its weight.\n\nA reset implies erasure. It assumes the past can be neutralized, that what came before can be dismissed without consequence. Resurrection does not erase anything. It does not undo Friday. It does not pretend suffering never happened. It does not rewind history and try again under improved conditions.\n\nResurrection binds what was to what will be.\n\nThe Christian claim is not that the story restarts, but that it continues differently. Sunday is not God saying, “Let’s begin again.” It is God saying, “This is not the end.”\n\nThis distinction matters because the risen Christ does not appear unmarked. The resurrection does not remove the wounds of crucifixion. The scars remain visible — not as evidence of defeat, but as proof of continuity. Glory does not cancel suffering. It carries it forward without being governed by it.\n\nThat alone should unsettle the way Sunday is often framed.\n\nIf resurrection were meant to provide emotional relief or narrative closure, the tomb would have been empty and silent. Instead, it becomes a site of interruption. The women arrive expecting finality. They encounter absence, confusion, and a question that reframes everything.\n\n“Why do you seek the living among the dead?”\n\nThis is not a rebuke. It is a reorientation.\n\nThe question exposes an assumption so familiar it often goes unnoticed: that death is where stories end, that loss is definitive, that history closes with violence and power. Resurrection does not deny those realities. It refuses to grant them ultimate authority.\n\nSunday, then, is not an emotional uplift. It is a recalibration of how reality is understood.\n\nModern life trains us to seek resets everywhere. We reset devices when they slow down. We reset schedules when they become overwhelming. We reset relationships by abandoning them when they accumulate too much complexity.\n\nResets are efficient. They promise relief without reckoning. They allow forward motion without continuity.\n\nResurrection offers no such escape.\n\nIt insists that what was broken is not discarded. What was lost is not dismissed. What was endured is not meaningless. The past is not erased; it is redeemed. And redemption is heavier than erasure because it preserves memory while altering outcome.\n\nThis is why Sunday faith is weightier than optimism.\n\nOptimism assumes conditions will improve. Resurrection declares that meaning does not depend on conditions at all. Even death — the most final condition imaginable — is no longer absolute.\n\nThat does not make life easier. It makes it more accountable.\n\nIf resurrection is true, then despair is no longer neutral. It becomes incomplete. Not immoral, necessarily, but misaligned with reality as it has been redefined. To live as if nothing ultimately changes is to live as if the tomb remained sealed.\n\nSunday corrects that posture.\n\nBut correction does not mean denial. Resurrection does not bypass suffering. The cross remains central because resurrection does not pretend it never happened. Faith is not a flight from pain but a refusal to allow pain to dictate the horizon of meaning.\n\nThis is why Sunday is not escapism.\n\nIt does not lift life out of fracture. It sends life back into fracture with a different orientation. Work resumes. Grief remains. Uncertainty persists. What changes is not circumstance, but direction.\n\nResurrection does not anesthetize. It anchors.\n\nAn anchor does not remove the storm. It prevents drift.\n\nSunday functions the same way. It does not cancel the week that preceded it. It refuses to let that week define what comes next. It binds the failures, losses, and unfinished work of Friday to a future that is not governed by collapse.\n\nThis is what reorientation means.\n\nA reset wipes the slate clean and pretends continuity does not matter. Reorientation preserves continuity and insists it matters deeply. Nothing is wasted. Nothing is outside the story. Nothing is beyond redemption.\n\nThat claim is quiet, but it is not soft.\n\nIt confronts the modern instinct to flee complexity. It resists the temptation to simplify life by cutting loose what hurts. It insists that faithfulness carries weight even when outcomes remain unresolved.\n\nSunday does not make the week lighter.\n\nIt makes the week intelligible.\n\nThe resurrection does not reduce the cost of living truthfully in the world. It gives that cost a destination. It asserts that time is not a closed loop of decay, but a movement toward restoration.\n\nThis is why Sunday is not a mood, a ritual, or a motivational device. It is a claim about reality itself. A claim that history bends somewhere. A claim that faithfulness is never invisible, even when it is unrewarded.\n\nSunday does not erase Friday.\n\nIt redeems it by refusing to let it be final.\n\nAnd that refusal — quietly rehearsed, week after week — is not a reset. It is a reorientation that makes endurance possible.",
