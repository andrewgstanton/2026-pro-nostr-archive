# Note 5 — Continuing Anyway - 2/9/2026

Not every day produces clarity.
Not every day produces validation.

Some days only produce another brick in a wall no one sees yet.

Continuing anyway is how walls become shelter.

Scripture

“Unless the Lord builds the house, those who build it labor in vain.” — Psalm 127:1
