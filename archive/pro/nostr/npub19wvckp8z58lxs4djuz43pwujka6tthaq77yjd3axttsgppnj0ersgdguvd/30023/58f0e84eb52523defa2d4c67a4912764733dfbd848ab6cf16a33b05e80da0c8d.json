Stanton - Jan. 30, 2026\n\n---\n\nContinuum is not a platform.\n\nIt is a **local publishing system** that allows content to be created, verified as authentic, and shared publicly without depending on centralized services.\n\n---\n\n## System Architecture (High Level)\n\nContinuum runs locally on a single machine using a Linux-compatible container environment.\n\nIt has been tested and is known to run on:\n- macOS using Docker\n- Windows using Docker with WSL\n\nContinuum has not yet been tested on native Linux systems, although no Linux-specific dependencies are known.\n\nThere is no hosted backend and no external service dependency.\n\n---\n\n## Identity and Authorship\n\nContinuum uses a simple but powerful idea:  \n**each piece of content is cryptographically tied to the identity that created it**.\n\nIn practical terms, this means:\n\n- Every published item includes proof of *who authored it*\n- That proof cannot be altered without detection\n- Readers and systems can independently verify authenticity\n\nYou can think of this like a **digital seal** attached to each publication.\n\nNo passwords are sent anywhere.  \nNo external service is required to confirm authorship.\n\n---\n\n## Supported Content Types (Current)\n\nContinuum currently supports creating, editing, deleting, and locally storing:\n\n- **Profiles** — identity metadata  \n- **Notes** — short-form posts  \n- **Articles** — long-form writing  \n- **Delete records** — explicit retractions (“tombstones”)\n\nDelete records are preserved intentionally so that removals are clear and verifiable rather than silent.\n\nDirect Messages (DMs) can be sent and received, but **are not archived yet**.\n\n---\n\n## Local Storage vs Public Sharing\n\nContinuum always stores authored content locally.\n\nPublic sharing is **explicit and intentional**. Nothing is automatically uploaded, mirrored, or archived.\n\nLong-term public archiving requires:\n1. Running a deliberate export process  \n2. Configuring a destination (such as a static site or repository)\n\nThis ensures:\n- No accidental exposure\n- Clear operational boundaries\n- Independence from third-party platforms\n\n---\n\n## Publishing Model\n\nPublishing is a conscious action.\n\nContinuum does not:\n- auto-publish\n- auto-sync\n- auto-backup to the cloud\n\nThis keeps behavior predictable and auditable.\n\n---\n\n## Security & Risk Profile\n\nContinuum minimizes risk by design:\n\n- No browser-based authentication\n- No remote credentials\n- No central account database\n- Small, inspectable system footprint\n\nIt can be run offline or in restricted environments.\n\n---\n\n## Design Philosophy\n\nContinuum favors:\n- Explicit actions over automation\n- Ownership over convenience\n- Integrity over abstraction\n- Durability over growth mechanics\n\nIt is infrastructure for people who want to **own their publishing workflow end-to-end**.\n\n---\n\n## Terminology Note\n\nUnder the hood, Continuum uses a protocol (Nostr) that refers to authorship verification as “signing” events.\n\nYou do **not** need to understand Nostr to operate or evaluate Continuum.\n\nThe important idea is simple:\n> Content can be proven authentic without trusting a platform.",
