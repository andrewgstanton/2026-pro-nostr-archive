# Note 2 — Quiet Work Still Counts - 2/10/2026

Verse:

“Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men.” — Colossians 3:23

The world rewards visibility.

God rewards faithfulness.

Some of the most important work you will ever do
will be unseen,
unapplauded,
misunderstood.

Do it anyway.

He sees.

Scripture:

“Your Father who sees in secret will reward you.” — Matthew 6:4
