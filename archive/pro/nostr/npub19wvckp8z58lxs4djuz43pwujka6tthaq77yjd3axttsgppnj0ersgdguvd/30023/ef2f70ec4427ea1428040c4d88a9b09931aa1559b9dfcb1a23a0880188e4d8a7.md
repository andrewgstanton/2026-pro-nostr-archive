- I’ve been building software for about 25 years, mostly in startup environments where I’ve owned architecture end-to-end.
- I’ve led and designed systems across multiple early-stage companies, typically taking products from zero to production.
- More recently I built a local-first publishing platform in Python using Docker and SQLite, where I implemented a pooled relay manager and cryptographic signing layer.
- I’m particularly interested in high-impact engineering roles where architecture and product direction intersect.

**if asking about local-first:**

- Offline-first, local-first architecture with cryptographic identity and distributed relay communication.
