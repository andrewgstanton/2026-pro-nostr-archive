Urgency is persuasive.

It tells us:
- now or never
- move or miss out
- act before it’s too late

But urgency is rarely the voice of renewal.

It is usually the voice of fear.

### God Does Not Rush  
Scripture is remarkably unhurried.

Promises unfold over decades.
Callings mature over lifetimes.
Fruit appears in seasons, not moments.

Urgency belongs to systems that fear collapse.
Renewal belongs to a Kingdom that cannot be shaken.

### Pressure Is Not Proof  
We often confuse pressure with importance.

“If it feels heavy, it must matter.”
“If it feels urgent, it must be right.”

But renewal often feels the opposite:
- quieter
- slower
- steadier

The most meaningful changes rarely announce themselves loudly.

### Faithfulness Over Acceleration  
Renewal is not about speed.
It is about direction.

A slow step in the right direction is infinitely more powerful than frantic motion in the wrong one.

This year does not need to be conquered.
It needs to be *walked*.

### The Invitation of the First Sunday  
This Sunday is not a starting gun.
It is a clearing of the throat.
A deep breath before speaking.

You are not behind.
You are not late.
You are not failing.

Renewal is already at work—often long before you notice it.

Let this year unfold.
Let your work deepen.
Let your life grow roots.

Urgency can wait.

Renewal cannot be forced.
