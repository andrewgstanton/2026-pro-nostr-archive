# Continuum Services

Just documenting this for reference:

Continuum currently includes

- Pro / Patron — one-time support ($250 or ~230,000 sats, 10% sats discount)
- Content archiving service — Markdown + JSON exports ($5 / 5,000 sats per month)
- Free NIP-05 identity verification service
- Per-article paid unlocks — $0.50 / 500 sats per article

All of it is built so **your identity and work remain exportable and rebuildable** without relying on a platform.
