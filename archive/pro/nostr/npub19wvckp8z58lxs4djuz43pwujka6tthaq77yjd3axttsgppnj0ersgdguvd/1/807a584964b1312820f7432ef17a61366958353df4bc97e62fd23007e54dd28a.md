1️⃣ Freedom Is Not Self-Creation - 2/24/2026

📖 Galatians 5:1

“For freedom Christ has set us free; stand firm therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery.”

Freedom in Scripture is not autonomy for its own sake.
It is deliverance — from sin, from fear, from striving to justify ourselves.

Paul is not talking about political liberty. He is talking about release from bondage to law as a means of self-righteousness.

True freedom is not “I define myself.”
It is “I no longer have to.”

Freedom removes the crushing burden of proving.
