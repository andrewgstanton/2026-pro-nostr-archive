# 1. Resilience Is Quiet  - 1/27/2026

Resilience rarely announces itself.
It shows up the next day — steady, unremarkable — when stopping would be easier.

The most durable work is usually invisible while it’s being formed.

“Let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap, if we do not give up.”
— Galatians 6:9
