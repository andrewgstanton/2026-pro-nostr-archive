## Why this exists

Most online interaction today optimizes for speed, visibility, and low commitment.

Likes, reposts, short replies, and vague encouragement are easy to give—but they rarely convey clear signal, accountability, or durable insight. Over time, this makes it difficult to tell the difference between real engagement and ambient noise.

I’m experimenting with an alternative model I call the **Sovereign Attribution Engine**.

This article is an invitation to participate in that experiment.

---

## What the Sovereign Attribution Engine is

The Sovereign Attribution Engine (SAE) is a simple interaction model with a few core properties:

- **Responses are authored, not reacted**
- **Responses are attributable and signed**
- **Responses are opt-in and non-extractive**
- **Silence is treated as valid data, not failure**

There are no feeds to game, no engagement metrics to optimize for, and no expectation that anyone respond unless they genuinely want to.

The goal is not volume.  
The goal is **signal**.

## What this specific experiment is testing

I’m currently building **Continuum**, a local-first tool for sovereign publishing, identity management, and durable archiving using Nostr.

Rather than asking for likes, reposts, or casual feedback, I want to understand something more specific:

> **What makes someone willing—or unwilling—to engage with a local-first, responsibility-heavy tool like Continuum?**

This experiment is designed to surface *thoughtful, attributable responses* to that question.

---

### A note on Continuum (for context only)

Continuum is a local-first application that runs in a self-contained Docker environment. It does not require cloud accounts, hosted services, or client dependencies, and it can be started or stopped entirely on your own machine.

You do **not** need to run Continuum, install anything, or understand its internals to participate in this experiment. The prompt is about willingness and tradeoffs, not hands-on evaluation.

---

## The prompt

If you choose to participate, respond to the following:

> **What would make you willing (or unwilling) to run and use a local-first tool like Continuum?**  
>  
> You may touch on:
> - responsibility and key ownership  
> - time and cognitive load  
> - trust and verification  
> - tooling expectations  
> - tradeoffs vs hosted services  
> - or anything else you find relevant

There is no “correct” answer.  

---

## How to participate

Participation is intentionally simple and explicit:

1. Write a thoughtful response to the prompt  
2. Sign it with your Nostr identity (or another clear attribution method)  
3. Send it to me via DM or as a signed event you control  

That’s it.

There is **no obligation** to continue the conversation afterward, and no expectation of follow-up.

---

## A clarification about “signed responses”

One clarification that matters.

On Nostr, you already author and sign responses constantly.

Every like, reply, repost, or reaction is:
- authored
- cryptographically signed
- attributable to your identity

Most of us do this dozens of times a day without a second thought.

What changes in this experiment is not the mechanics, but the **intent**.

Instead of reacting in passing, this asks for a response that is:
- written deliberately
- meant to stand on its own
- offered with the understanding that it may be quoted with attribution

That shift—from ambient reaction to intentional authorship—is what may cause hesitation.

If you choose not to participate, that’s completely fine.  
The hesitation itself is part of what this experiment is measuring.

## Attribution and use

By submitting a response, you agree that:

- Your response is **authored and attributable**
- I may **quote or reference** it with attribution in future writing or analysis
- Your words remain **yours**, not extracted or anonymized by default

If you want to specify attribution preferences, you may do so in your response.

---

## Compensation (symbolic, not extractive)

To acknowledge the time and care involved, I will offer:

- **1,000 sats** for accepted responses  
- This is **not** payment for labor or volume  
- It is a gesture of acknowledgment, not an incentive to rush

I may not acknowledge every response.
 
Responses must be offered in good faith. 
Disagreement and criticism are welcome; abusive or dismissive submissions are not.

---

## What this is *not*

To be explicit, this is **not**:

- a popularity contest  
- a marketing funnel  
- a request for endorsement  
- a test of loyalty or alignment  
- a debate staged for public performance  

It is a bounded experiment in **sovereign interaction**.

---

## If this resonates

If this model makes sense to you—and you’re willing to author a real response—I’d be glad to hear from you.

If it doesn’t, that’s useful data too.

No pressure.  
No urgency.  
No follow-up required.

---

### Scope and limits

This experiment is intentionally small.

I plan to acknowledge **up to 10 responses**. Once that number is reached, I won’t be accepting additional submissions.

This isn’t about urgency or competition—it’s about keeping the experiment bounded and manageable.

---

### Closing note

One of the things I’m learning, repeatedly, is that **clarity and honesty matter more than scale**.

This article is an attempt to create space for that kind of interaction—even if only a few people ever step into it.
