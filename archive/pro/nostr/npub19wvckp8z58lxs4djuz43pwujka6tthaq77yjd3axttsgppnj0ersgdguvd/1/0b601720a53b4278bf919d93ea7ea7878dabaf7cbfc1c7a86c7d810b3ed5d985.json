  "content": "# Continuum - Local First Publishing Clarification\n\nContinuum runs locally on your own computer.\nYour writing, keys, and signing stay local. No website. No login.\n\nPublishing happens from the same program — it just sends a copy out. The original always stays with you.\n\nSovereignty here is about control of execution, data, and authorship — not ideological maximalism.\n\nMobile clients trade sovereignty for convenience. That’s a valid tradeoff.\nContinuum makes a different one.\n\nUse what fits your needs.\n\nFor clarity: I use Primal on my phone as well as Continuum. This isn’t an either/or.",
