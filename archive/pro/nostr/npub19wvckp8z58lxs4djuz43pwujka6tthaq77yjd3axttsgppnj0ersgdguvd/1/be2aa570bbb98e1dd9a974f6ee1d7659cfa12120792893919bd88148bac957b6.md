# 4️⃣ Saying No Is Marketing - 2/17/2026

Every yes is a public statement.

Every no is a boundary.

Strategic marketing includes declining misaligned opportunities.

Not every conversation deserves your calendar.
Not every collaboration advances your mission.

Clarity attracts gravity.

Boundaries build brand.

Scripture

“Let what you say be simply ‘Yes’ or ‘No’…” — Matthew 5:37
