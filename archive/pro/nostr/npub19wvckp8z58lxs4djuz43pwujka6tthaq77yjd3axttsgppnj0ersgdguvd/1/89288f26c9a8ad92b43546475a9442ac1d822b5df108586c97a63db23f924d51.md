# ✏️ Notes are now editable in Continuum

When you create a note in Continuum, it’s published with a d-tag by default — which means it can now be edited and republished cleanly, without deleting history or reposting noise.

This is a big step toward treating notes like documents, not disposable social posts.

Small feature. Big implications.

(I just edited this note FYI -- this edit was added to the original note content above)
