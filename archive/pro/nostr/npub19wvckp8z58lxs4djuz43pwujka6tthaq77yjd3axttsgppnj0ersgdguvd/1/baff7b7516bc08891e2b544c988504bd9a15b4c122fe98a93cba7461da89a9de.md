Stop before you are forced to. 2/28/2026

If you only rest when you collapse,  
that is not Sabbath — that is recovery.

Sabbath is strength choosing restraint  
while you still have energy to continue.

Freedom is disciplined rhythm, not endless motion.

“Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a sabbath to the Lord your God.” — Exodus 20:9–10
