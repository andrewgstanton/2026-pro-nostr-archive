Andrew G. Stanton - Dec. 31. 2025

Every year leaves something behind.

Sometimes it leaves answers.  
Sometimes only lessons.  
Sometimes only endurance.

If you are ending this year tired, that does not mean you are empty.

It often means you have been **faithful without relief**.

There is a kind of strength that doesn’t announce itself.  
It doesn’t look like victory.  
It looks like staying.

In older cultures, fire was not endlessly re-lit.  
It was **carried**.

Sheltered from wind.  
Fed carefully.  
Passed from hand to hand.

That is what this moment asks of us.

Not to ignite something entirely new —  
but to protect what is already alive.

A conviction that held.  
A piece of work that endured.  
A truth you refused to trade away.  
A calling that remained, even when energy thinned.

You do not need the whole path illuminated.  
You only need enough light for the next step.

The coming year will bring its own demands.  
But what has been guarded with care is stronger than it looks.

So carry the fire forward.

Not with urgency —  
with confidence.

**A Benediction for the Year Ahead**

May the ground before you open gently.  
May what you have guarded now begin to grow.  
May your patience be met with clarity, and your faith with provision.

You are not late.  
You are not forgotten.  
And what you have carried was not in vain.

Carry the fire forward —  
and step into the year ahead with quiet strength.
