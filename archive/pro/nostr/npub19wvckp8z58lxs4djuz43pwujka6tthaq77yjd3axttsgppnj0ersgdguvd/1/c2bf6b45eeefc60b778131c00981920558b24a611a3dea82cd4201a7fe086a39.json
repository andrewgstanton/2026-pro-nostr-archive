They simply refuse to lie.\n\nPause.\n\nIf you’re scrolling, keep scrolling.\nIf you actually read this, reply **“read”** (public reply or DM).\n\nEvery ranking system encodes values, whether admitted or not.  \nChronology is the only ordering that doesn’t pretend otherwise.\n\nIt doesn’t tell you what matters.  \nIt tells you *what happened*, and lets you decide.\n\nThat restraint is rare.  \nAnd increasingly necessary.\n\n#sovereignty #nostr #continuum #feeds #agency",
