📝 Note 1 — Stewardship, Not Convenience - 2/25/2026

Self-custody is not a feature.

It is a responsibility.

Private keys are not meant to be abstracted away because abstraction feels safer. They are meant to be guarded because ownership requires weight.

Most people say they value sovereignty. Very few are willing to carry it.

Convenience scales faster than responsibility.
But stewardship endures.

“Moreover, it is required of stewards that they be found faithful.”
— 1 Corinthians 4:2
