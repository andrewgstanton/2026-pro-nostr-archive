The first day did not ask Rome for permission.

The stone moved without a committee.

Resurrection is the ultimate unauthorized act.

It did not poll the crowd.  
It did not secure funding.  
It did not request validation.

It simply happened.

And that is the pattern for sovereign builders.

If you wait for permission, you will wait forever.

If you wait for consensus, you will dilute conviction.

Sunday is a declaration:

Death does not have final authority.

And in smaller ways, that applies to ideas too.

Ideas that are ignored are not dead.  
Projects without funding are not dead.  
Work without applause is not dead.

Sometimes they are simply early.

The first day energy is quiet but unstoppable.

You wake up.

You build.

You publish.

Not because someone asked you to.

Because you are called to.
