5️⃣ Freedom Requires Courage - 2/24/2026
 
📖 Proverbs 29:25

“The fear of man lays a snare, but whoever trusts in the LORD is safe.”

Fear traps.

Approval traps.

Reputation traps.

Trust releases.

Freedom is often less about breaking external chains and more about refusing internal snares.

Trust in the Lord removes the need to calculate every reaction.

That is quiet strength.
