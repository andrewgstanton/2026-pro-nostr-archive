# README index — Continuum bounty

For anyone wondering what’s involved in testing Continuum locally, I’ve published the exact READMEs below (as separate notes).

Nothing hidden. No surprises.

• README_FIRST.md
• README_FIRST_MAC.md
• README_FIRST_WINDOWS.md

If, after skimming, this resonates, DM me and I’ll share the test bundle + verification details.
