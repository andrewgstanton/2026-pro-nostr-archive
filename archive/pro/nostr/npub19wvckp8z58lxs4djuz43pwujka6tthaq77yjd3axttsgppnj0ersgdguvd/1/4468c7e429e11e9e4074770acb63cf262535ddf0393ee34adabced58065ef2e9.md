# Publishing cadence (FYI) - 1/31/2026

During the week (Mon–Fri), I publish primarily paid long-form articles.
These are still standard long-form posts (kind:30023), but the main content is encrypted.

On weekends, all articles are published unencrypted (free).

Notes are almost always unencrypted — I post ~5 notes per day on average.

If you want to read a paid article:

DM me the article name

Send me 500 sats

I’ll send you the full unencrypted link

That’s it. Simple.
