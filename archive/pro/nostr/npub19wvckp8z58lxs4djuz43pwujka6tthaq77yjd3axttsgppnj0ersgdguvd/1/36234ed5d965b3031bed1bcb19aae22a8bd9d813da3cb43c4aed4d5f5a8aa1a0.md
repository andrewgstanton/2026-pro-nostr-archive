# ✏️ Notes are now editable in Continuum

When you create a note in Continuum, it’s published with a d-tag by default — which means it can now be edited and republished cleanly, without deleting history or reposting noise.

This is a big step toward treating notes like documents, not disposable social posts.

Small feature. Big implications.

(I just edited this note FYI -- this edit was added to the original note content above)

ALSO:

- Continuum edits don’t change Nostr. They change the authoring layer.
- Notes published with a d-tag become editable “documents” in Continuum. 
- Most clients won’t surface that.
