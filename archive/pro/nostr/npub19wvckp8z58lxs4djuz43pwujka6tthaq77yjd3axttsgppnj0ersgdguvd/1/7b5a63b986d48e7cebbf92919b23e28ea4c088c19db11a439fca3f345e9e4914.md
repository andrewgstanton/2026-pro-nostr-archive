# Note 1 - 1/30/2026

1️⃣ Building isn’t about rejecting tools — it’s about not mistaking tools for foundations.
A client can be beautiful, fast, even joyful… but without a foundation underneath, you’re just visiting, not inhabiting.

Continuum is the foundation.
Clients are the view.

You don’t skip the foundation because the balcony has a nice sunset.

“Unless the Lord builds the house, those who build it labor in vain.” — Psalm 127:1
