# Founder Advisory Sprints

Some decisions are too important to outsource — and too complex to solve alone.

I offer short, paid advisory sprints for founders building infrastructure-heavy or high-consequence systems.

This is not mentorship theater.
It is not an ongoing obligation.
It is a defined window for thinking clearly together.

What this is:

A 3–4 week sprint (typically 4–6 sessions) focused on decisions you are actively wrestling with.

Common areas of focus include:

* architectural direction and constraint design
* incentive alignment and governance risk
* AI + identity tradeoffs
* where speed helps — and where it quietly damages the system
* what you should not build or promise
* This is structured thinking under pressure.

What this is not:

* not a board seat
* not coaching
* not growth consulting
* not staff augmentation
* not a path to equity or control
* The sprint ends cleanly.

Why this exists:

Founders are often forced to choose between thinking alone under pressure or bringing in people who come with agendas.

This format is meant to be bounded, honest, pressure-reducing, and respectful of your autonomy.

You remain the decision-maker.

Engagement details:

* 4–6 sessions over ~1 month
* Clear focus and defined scope
* Written summary of key risks and tradeoffs
* Typical range: $2k–$4k per sprint

If you’re building something where correctness matters more than optics — and you want a second brain without strings attached — this is what I offer.

DM if this resonates.
