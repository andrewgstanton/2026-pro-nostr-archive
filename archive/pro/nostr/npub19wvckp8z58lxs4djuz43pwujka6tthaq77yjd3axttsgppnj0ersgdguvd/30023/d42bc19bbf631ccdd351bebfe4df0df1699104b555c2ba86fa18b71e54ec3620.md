Stewardship is an unfashionable word.

It implies responsibility rather than ambition, care rather than conquest, limits rather than domination.

Yet stewardship may be the most accurate frame for intentional work.

### Work Shapes People

Every artifact shapes its users.  
Tools influence habits.  
Systems influence behavior.

To build without acknowledging this is to abdicate responsibility.

### Resisting Exploitation

Exploitation often hides behind efficiency.

Stewardship asks harder questions:
- What does this reward?
- What does this normalize?
- What kind of person does this train users to become?

These questions slow things down. That is their virtue.

### Serving Without Mortgaging the Future

Many systems extract value today by borrowing against tomorrow.

Stewardship refuses this trade. It seeks sustainability—technical, relational, and moral.

### Faithful, Quiet Work

Stewarded work rarely shouts. It simply remains dependable.

People return to it not because they are compelled, but because it keeps its promises.

### Scripture Reflection

“Moreover, it is required of stewards that they be found faithful.” — 1 Corinthians 4:2
