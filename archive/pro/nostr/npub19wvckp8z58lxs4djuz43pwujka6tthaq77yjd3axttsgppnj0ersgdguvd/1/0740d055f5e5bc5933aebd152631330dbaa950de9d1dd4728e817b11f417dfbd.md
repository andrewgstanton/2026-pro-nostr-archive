# Bitcoin Isn’t Moral. It’s Honest. - 1/6/2026

Bitcoin doesn’t make people good.

It just removes the lie.

It doesn’t promise justice —
it removes the ability to counterfeit it at scale.

That’s why it feels uncomfortable.
Truth often does.

Honesty is not salvation.
But without honesty, salvation language collapses into theater.
