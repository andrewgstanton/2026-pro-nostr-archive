This isn’t a critique of Nostr clients.

Clients are essential.

They make the protocol visible.
They make conversation fluid.
They make discovery possible.
They reduce friction for participation.

Without clients, most people would never experience Nostr at all.

But clients are interfaces.

Local-first publishing is origin.

When I say a certain kind of freedom doesn’t exist purely on clients, I’m not criticizing them.

I’m describing something structural.

Clients focus on interaction:
- viewing feeds
- replying
- reacting
- managing relay connections
- signing events through browser extensions or integrated key handling

Local-first publishing focuses on custody:
- generating and storing keys under your control
- signing artifacts independently of any UI session
- maintaining a deterministic local archive
- anchoring canonical history outside any single interface

On a client, you interact with the network.
Locally, you anchor yourself within it.

On a client, identity is loaded into the interface.
Locally, identity originates from keys you hold and manage directly.

Both are important.
Both are necessary.

But they serve different layers of the stack.

Clients make Nostr usable.

Local-first makes it grounded.

I’m grateful for both.
