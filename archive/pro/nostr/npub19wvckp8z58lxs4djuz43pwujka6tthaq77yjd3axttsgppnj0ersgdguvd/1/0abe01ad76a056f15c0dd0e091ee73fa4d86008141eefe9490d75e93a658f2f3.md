# 1️⃣ Strategic Marketing Is Signal Allocation - 2/17/2026

Most marketing isn’t persuasion.

It’s signal allocation.

Where do you place attention?
Who gets your time?
What conversations do you amplify?
What requests do you decline?

Marketing starts long before promotion.

It starts with focus.

If you don’t allocate your signal deliberately, the world will allocate it for you.

Scripture

“Look carefully then how you walk, not as unwise but as wise, making the best use of the time…” — Ephesians 5:15–16
