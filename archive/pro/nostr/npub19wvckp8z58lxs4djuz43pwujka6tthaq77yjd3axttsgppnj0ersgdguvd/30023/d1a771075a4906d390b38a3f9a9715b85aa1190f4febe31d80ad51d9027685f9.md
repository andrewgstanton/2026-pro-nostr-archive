Bitcoin is not empowering in the way people expect.

It does not make life easier.
It does not reduce responsibility.
It does not protect you from yourself.

It does the opposite.

## The Infantilization of Modern Systems

Most modern systems are designed to:
- Absorb mistakes quietly
- Hide consequences
- Offer recovery without accountability

This creates convenience.
It also creates dependency.

Users are trained to assume someone else is responsible.

Bitcoin breaks this pattern immediately.

## Self-Custody Is Not a Feature

Self-custody is often marketed as a benefit.

In reality, it is a **burden**.

It requires:
- Attention
- Discipline
- Care
- Long-term thinking

Lose your keys, and the system does not negotiate.

Bitcoin does not infantilize its users by pretending otherwise.

## Why This Feels Hostile at First

Many people encounter Bitcoin and conclude:
“This is too stressful.”

They are not wrong.

Bitcoin removes the illusion of safety nets.
It exposes the reality that:
- Risk cannot be eliminated
- Responsibility cannot be outsourced
- Freedom is inseparable from consequence

This is unsettling.

It is also clarifying.

## Maturity as a Prerequisite for Sovereignty

Bitcoin does not grant sovereignty.
It **requires it**.

It filters for people willing to:
- Learn
- Adapt
- Accept fault
- Improve operational discipline

This is not elitism.
It is necessity.

A monetary system that cannot enforce responsibility collapses.

## The Unexpected Outcome

Something strange happens over time.

Users who stay:
- Become calmer
- Think longer-term
- Take fewer reckless risks
- Stop expecting rescue

Bitcoin reshapes behavior.

Not through coercion.
Through structure.

---

## Conclusion

Bitcoin does not promise comfort.

It offers adulthood.

In a world optimized for perpetual adolescence,  
that may be its most revolutionary trait.
