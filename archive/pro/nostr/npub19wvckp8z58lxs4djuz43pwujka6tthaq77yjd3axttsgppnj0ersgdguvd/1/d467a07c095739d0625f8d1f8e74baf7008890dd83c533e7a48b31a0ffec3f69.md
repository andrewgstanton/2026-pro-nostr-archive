What endures is what is anchored.

If the archive is independent of platform,
if authorship is cryptographic,
if custody is local—

then the foundation is stronger than the interface.

Storms test architecture.

Foundations decide outcomes.

“The rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock.”
— Matthew 7:25
