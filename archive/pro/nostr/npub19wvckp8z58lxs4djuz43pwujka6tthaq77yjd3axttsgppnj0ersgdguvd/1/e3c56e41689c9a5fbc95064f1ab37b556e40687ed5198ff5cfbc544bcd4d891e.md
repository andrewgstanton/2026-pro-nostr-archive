# 🔆 Note 5 — We’re Still Early in the Story - 2/11/2026

Verse:

“For I know the plans I have for you… plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope.” — Jeremiah 29:11

Bitcoin is young.

Nostr is young.

Your work is young.

The story isn’t finished.

Don’t measure a long arc with a short ruler.

There is more ahead than behind.

Scripture:

“Being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion.” — Philippians 1:6
