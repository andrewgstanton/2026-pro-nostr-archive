# Note 2 — Sunday Rest Is Forward-Looking - 2/8/2026

Sabbath looks backward.
Sunday looks forward.

Rest says: creation is good.
Resurrection says: creation will be healed.

We do not rest because the work is finished.
We rest because death did not win.

Verse:

“If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.” — 2 Corinthians 5:17
