# Note 2 — Convenience Is Not Freedom - 2/13/2026

The cloud made everything easy.

One login.
One password reset.
One subscription that quietly renews forever.

But ease and freedom are not the same thing.

It is easier to rent than to own.
It is easier to delegate responsibility than to carry it.
It is easier to let someone else hold your keys.

Local-first feels heavier at first — Docker installs, JSON identity files, backups.

But the irony is this:
discipline restores dignity.

When you hold your own keys, you hold your own story.

“The borrower is the slave of the lender.”
— Proverbs 22:7
