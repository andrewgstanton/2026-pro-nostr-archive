Stanton - Jan. 4, 2026\n\n---\n\nThe world teaches renewal as acceleration.\n\nNew year.\nNew goals.\nNew systems.\nNew momentum.\n\nBut Scripture teaches renewal as *return*.\n\n> “Be still, and know that I am God.”  \n\nThe first movement of renewal is not action—it is *recognition*.\n\n### Rest is Not Laziness  \nRest is alignment.\n\nRest is the act of laying down false weights:\n- the need to prove\n- the pressure to produce\n- the fear of falling behind\n\nWhen we rest, we declare—whether consciously or not—that the world does not depend on our constant output.\n\n### Why the First Sunday Matters  \nThe first Sunday of the year is not about setting tone through intensity.\nIt is about setting tone through *orientation*.\n\nBefore the year asks anything of you, God asks one thing:\n\n> “Come to Me.”\n\nNot with plans.\nNot with metrics.\nNot with explanations.\n\nJust come.\n\n### Renewal Is a Gift, Not a Project  \nYou cannot engineer renewal.\nYou can only receive it.\n\nRest clears the noise.\nStillness recalibrates the heart.\nSilence restores perspective.\n\nThis Sunday is not wasted time.\nIt is *foundation time*.\n\nRenewal begins when we stop running long enough to be found.\n\nAnd that is more than enough for today.",
