## Technical Overview for Implementers and Support Teams

Continuum is not a platform.

It is a **local publishing system** that allows content to be created, verified as authentic, and shared publicly without depending on centralized services.

---

## System Architecture (High Level)

Continuum runs locally on a single machine using a Linux-compatible container environment.

It has been tested and is known to run on:
- macOS using Docker
- Windows using Docker with WSL

Continuum has not yet been tested on native Linux systems, although no Linux-specific dependencies are known.

There is no hosted backend and no external service dependency.

## Identity and Authorship

Continuum uses a simple but powerful idea:  
**each piece of content is cryptographically tied to the identity that created it**.

In practical terms, this means:

- Every published item includes proof of *who authored it*
- That proof cannot be altered without detection
- Readers and systems can independently verify authenticity

You can think of this like a **digital seal** attached to each publication.

No passwords are sent anywhere.  
No external service is required to confirm authorship.

---

## Supported Content Types (Current)

Continuum currently supports creating, editing, deleting, and locally storing:

- **Profiles** — identity metadata  
- **Notes** — short-form posts  
- **Articles** — long-form writing  
- **Delete records** — explicit retractions (“tombstones”)

Delete records are preserved intentionally so that removals are clear and verifiable rather than silent.

Direct Messages (DMs) can be sent and received, but **are not archived yet**.

---

## Local Storage vs Public Sharing

Continuum always stores authored content locally.

Public sharing is **explicit and intentional**. Nothing is automatically uploaded, mirrored, or archived.

Long-term public archiving requires:
1. Running a deliberate export process  
2. Configuring a destination (such as a static site or repository)

This ensures:
- No accidental exposure
- Clear operational boundaries
- Independence from third-party platforms

---

## Publishing Model

Publishing is a conscious action.

Continuum does not:
- auto-publish
- auto-sync
- auto-backup to the cloud

This keeps behavior predictable and auditable.

---

## Security & Risk Profile

Continuum minimizes risk by design:

- No browser-based authentication
- No remote credentials
- No central account database
- Small, inspectable system footprint

It can be run offline or in restricted environments.

---

## Design Philosophy

Continuum favors:
- Explicit actions over automation
- Ownership over convenience
- Integrity over abstraction
- Durability over growth mechanics

It is infrastructure for people who want to **own their publishing workflow end-to-end**.

---

## Terminology Note

Under the hood, Continuum uses a protocol (Nostr) that refers to authorship verification as “signing” events.

You do **not** need to understand Nostr to operate or evaluate Continuum.

The important idea is simple:
> Content can be proven authentic without trusting a platform.
