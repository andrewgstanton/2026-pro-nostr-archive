# 3️⃣ Pricing Is Marketing - 2/17/2026

Your price communicates before you do.

Cheap signals insecurity.
Premium without depth signals ego.
Intentional pricing signals identity.

Strategic marketing is not discounting to win attention.

It’s pricing to attract conviction.

Your pricing is a filter.

Use it wisely.

Scripture

“The plans of the diligent lead surely to abundance…” — Proverbs 21:5
