# A small but important change in Continuum.

When I’m viewing someone’s npub, I can now save it locally as a read-only identity reference.

No private keys.
No signing.
No impersonation.

It’s not their identity — it’s my reference to it.

This matters because it shifts how discovery works. Instead of identities only existing in a scrolling feed, they can exist as durable, local references — the same way bookmarks, contacts, or citations do.

You’re not “holding” anyone’s identity.
You’re acknowledging that you encountered it — and that it mattered enough to keep track of.

Clear boundaries matter in sovereign systems:

keys are authority

references are memory

Continuum is deliberately separating the two.
