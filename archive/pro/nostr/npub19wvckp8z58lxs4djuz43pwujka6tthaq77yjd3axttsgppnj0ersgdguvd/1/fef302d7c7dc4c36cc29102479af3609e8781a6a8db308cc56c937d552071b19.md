# Note 2 - 2/12/2026

Joy doesn’t always arrive after success.

Sometimes it arrives after faithfulness.

Fix one thing.
Write one paragraph.
Take one steady step.

Not because it trends.
Not because it pays immediately.
But because it is right.

Steady obedience produces a deeper satisfaction than applause ever could.

“Well done, good and faithful servant… You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much.” — Matthew 25:21
