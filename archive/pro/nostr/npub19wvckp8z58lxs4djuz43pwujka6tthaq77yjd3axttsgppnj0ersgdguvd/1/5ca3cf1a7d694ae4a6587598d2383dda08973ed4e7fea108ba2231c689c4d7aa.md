# Note 5 - 1/30/2026

5️⃣ If you only build where others can see, you’re not building — you’re performing.
Foundations are poured where applause doesn’t reach.

Continuum matters to me because it lets me build once —
and stand anywhere later.

If you skip the foundation, you’re not early.
You’re exposed.

“Do not despise these small beginnings.” — Zechariah 4:10
