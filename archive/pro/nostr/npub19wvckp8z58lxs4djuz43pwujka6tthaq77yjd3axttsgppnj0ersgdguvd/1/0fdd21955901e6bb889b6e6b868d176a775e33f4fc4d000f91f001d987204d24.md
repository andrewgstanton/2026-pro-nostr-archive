📝 Note 2 — Build Quietly - 2/25/2026

You do not need applause to keep building.

Silence is not disproof.
Lack of reaction is not lack of substance.

Some work is upstream.
It only becomes obvious later.

The temptation is to measure impact too early.

Better to measure faithfulness instead.

“And let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap, if we do not give up.”
— Galatians 6:9
