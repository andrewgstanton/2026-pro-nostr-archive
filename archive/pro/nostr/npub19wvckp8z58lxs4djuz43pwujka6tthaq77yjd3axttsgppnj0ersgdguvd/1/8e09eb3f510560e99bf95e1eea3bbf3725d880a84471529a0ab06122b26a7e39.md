# Note 2 - 1/31/2026

2️⃣ We just built a “Verify Event” tool in Continuum.
And mirrored it in the archive.

That means you don’t have to trust a client, a relay, or a personality.
You can independently verify authorship — forever.

That’s not convenience.
That’s resilience.

“Test all things; hold fast what is good.”
— 1 Thessalonians 5:2
