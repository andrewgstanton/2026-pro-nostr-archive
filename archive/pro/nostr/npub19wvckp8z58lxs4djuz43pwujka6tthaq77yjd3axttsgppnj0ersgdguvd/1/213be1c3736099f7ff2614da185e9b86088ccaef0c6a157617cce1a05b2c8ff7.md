# Note 4 - Obedience Without Outcomes - 2/6/2026

**Verse:**  
> “Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding.” — Proverbs 3:5

Obedience is not a contract.  
It does not come with guaranteed results or timelines.

If you only obey when you can see the outcome,  
you are still in control.

True obedience moves without clarity —  
and rests without proof.

**Scripture:**  
> “By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out… And he went out, not knowing where he was going.” — Hebrews 11:8
