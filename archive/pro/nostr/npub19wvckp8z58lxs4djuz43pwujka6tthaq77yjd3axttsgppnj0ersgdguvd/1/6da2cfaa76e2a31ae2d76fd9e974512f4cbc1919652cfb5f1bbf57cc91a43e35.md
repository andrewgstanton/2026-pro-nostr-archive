# Be consistent - 2/9/2026

People are living a lie.

We say we don’t like our identities and data being siloed.

And yet we build systems and businesses that do exactly that to others.

Not out of malice — but because incentives reward capture, not exit.

Sovereignty isn’t a belief.
It’s an architectural choice.
