I value thoughtful conversations and meaningful collaboration.  
To protect focused build time, I structure external discussions intentionally.

## Why This Policy Exists

I’m actively building infrastructure in the sovereignty and identity space.  
Protecting deep creation time allows that work to compound.

If there’s real alignment, I’m genuinely open to structured collaboration.

If not, I wish you well in your search.
