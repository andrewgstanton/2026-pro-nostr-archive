# Note 4 - 1/31/2026

4️⃣ Clients come and go.
Relays prune.
UIs change.

But a signed event + a local archive + a verify tool?
That stack doesn’t panic when the internet sneezes.

That’s calm strength.
That’s resilience by design.

“You will keep him in perfect peace,
whose mind is stayed on You,
because he trusts in You.”
— Isaiah 26:3
