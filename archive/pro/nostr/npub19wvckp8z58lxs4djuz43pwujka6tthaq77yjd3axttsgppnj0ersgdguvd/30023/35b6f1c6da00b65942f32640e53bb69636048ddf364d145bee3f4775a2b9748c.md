Andrew G. Stanton - Jan. 4, 2026

---

January carries an unspoken demand:

“Become someone better.”
“Become someone stronger.”
“Become someone more impressive.”

But renewal does not ask you to become someone else.

It asks you to become *more fully yourself*.

### Renewal Is Subtraction, Not Addition  
We think change comes from adding:
- more habits
- more structure
- more effort

But most renewal comes from letting go:
- false expectations
- borrowed ambitions
- identities that were never ours to carry

Growth often feels like relief, not strain.

### You Were Not Lost  
You don’t need to “find yourself.”
You were never missing.

You were buried under noise.
Under urgency.
Under comparison.

Renewal is the quiet uncovering of what was always there.

### The Grace of Continuity  
There is grace in continuity.
In faithfulness.
In remaining.

The pressure to reinvent is often a distraction from the deeper work of *remaining rooted*.

> “Abide in Me.”

Not restart.
Not rebrand.
Not outrun.

Abide.

### A Gentler Beginning  
This year does not require a dramatic entrance.

It requires honesty.
Patience.
Presence.

You do not have to become someone new in order to be renewed.

You only have to stop pretending you were never enough to begin with.
