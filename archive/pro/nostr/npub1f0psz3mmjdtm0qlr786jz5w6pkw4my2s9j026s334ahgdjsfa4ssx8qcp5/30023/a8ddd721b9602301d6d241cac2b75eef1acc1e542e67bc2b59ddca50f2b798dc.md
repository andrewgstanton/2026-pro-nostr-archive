Hey Indie Hackers 👋
Many teams are unfunded or underfunded — yet still need to ship real applications.

Even technical founders hit the same limit:

- building a full application alone is hard, even with AI tools
- hiring requires cash
- fundraising isn’t guaranteed

StartNation helps startups build applications using a model called Hybrid-Source Development (HSD).

HSD is an open-source-inspired, async development model where equity-aligned human builders use AI tools to ship applications — without significant upfront cash.

What makes HSD work:

- Async-first execution → work moves forward across time zones
- Modular development → clear ownership, clean handoffs
- Recognition + equity → contribution badges/honors + real ownership
- Protected IP → critical modules stay private and controlled by the startup

If you’re building an application and capital is tight, we’re happy to chat.
