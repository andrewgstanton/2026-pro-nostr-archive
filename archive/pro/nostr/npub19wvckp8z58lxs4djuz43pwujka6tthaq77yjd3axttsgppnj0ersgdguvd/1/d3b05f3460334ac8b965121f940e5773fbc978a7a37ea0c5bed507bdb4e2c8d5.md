# Note 2 — Continuing Is a Skill - 2/9/2026

Starting gets celebrated.
Continuing rarely does.

But continuation is where judgment forms.
Where shortcuts get resisted.
Where systems either harden correctly — or collapse later.

Most people can start.
Few can continue honestly.

Scripture

“The one who endures to the end will be saved.” — Matthew 24:13
