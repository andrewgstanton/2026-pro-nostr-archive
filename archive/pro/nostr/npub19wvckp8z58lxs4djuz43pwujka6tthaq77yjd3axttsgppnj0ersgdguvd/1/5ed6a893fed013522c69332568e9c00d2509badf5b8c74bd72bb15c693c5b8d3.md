Continuum pricing (for clarity)

Paid articles
• 500 sats per article
• delivered unencrypted via direct link

Continuum Pro — $250 one-time (10% discount if paid in sats)

Includes:
• support for multiple npub identities
• create and manage multiple keypairs with ease
• local-first architecture
• no client or platform dependencies
• export tools: HTML, PDF, Markdown, Rich Text
• a tool to verify ANY Nostr event
• permanent, unencrypted access to all paid articles
• Continuum Archiving Service included at no additional cost:
  – durable archiving of notes
  – durable archiving of long-form articles
  – durable archiving of profile metadata
• optional NIP-05 identity support included
• future support for DMs with arbitrarily large attachments
• unlimited software updates (access to the latest version of Continuum)

Continuum Pro is a one-time support purchase, not a subscription.

Optional: NIP-05 Identity (standalone — for those not on Continuum Pro)
• 25,000 sats / year
• name@mycontinuum.xyz identifier
• hosted .well-known/nostr.json
• mapped to your existing npub
• non-custodial (no keys held)
• compatible with all major Nostr clients

NIP-05 is not required to use Continuum.
It’s for those who want a verifiable, human-readable identity without relying on custodial platforms.

Continuum Archiving Service — 5,000 sats / month or 50,000 sats / year
(for those not on Continuum Pro)

Includes:
• durable archiving of notes
• durable archiving of long-form articles
• durable archiving of profile metadata

This option exists when the full Continuum Pro setup is not feasible.

Yearly maintenance — $250 (optional)
• setup assistance
• modest ongoing help keeping Continuum running smoothly

No one is required to pay yearly maintenance.
All Continuum Pro users receive unlimited software updates regardless.

Do I need Pro?

No — not everyone does.
• If you mainly read notes and occasional free articles, you don’t need Pro.
• If you only want a specific paid article, 500 sats is enough.

Yes — Pro is likely for you if:
• you want long-term, unencrypted access to paid articles
• you want archiving without a recurring service fee
• you manage or plan to manage multiple npubs
• you want optional NIP-05 identity support without managing hosting yourself
• you want tools that don’t depend on third-party clients
• you value ownership and durability over subscriptions

Continuum is not a subscription platform.
It’s infrastructure and support for durable, sovereign publishing.
