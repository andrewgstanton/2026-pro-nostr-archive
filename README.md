 ### CI / Pages Note

This repository uses GitHub Pages for static hosting.

GitHub automatically runs a system-managed “pages build and deployment”
workflow. No custom CI or deploy scripts are defined here.

If you receive Pages or Actions emails:
- Disable **GitHub Actions email notifications** globally:
  GitHub → Settings → Notifications → Email notifications → Actions → OFF

This is expected behavior and not a misconfiguration.
