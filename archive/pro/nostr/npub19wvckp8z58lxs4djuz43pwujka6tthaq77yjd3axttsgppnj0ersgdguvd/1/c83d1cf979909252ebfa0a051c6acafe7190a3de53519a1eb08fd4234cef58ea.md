# Short Architecture & Risk Reviews

Most teams don’t fail from lack of talent.
They fail when hidden constraints surface too late.

I offer short, fixed-scope architecture & risk reviews for teams building complex systems — especially around identity, data ownership, AI, and long-term durability.

What this is:
• a 2–3 week, time-boxed review
• architecture, identity, data, AI risk, failure modes
• written assessment + concrete recommendations

What this is not:
• not a rewrite
• not staff augmentation
• not an open-ended advisory role

Fixed scope. Fixed timeline. Clear start and end.
Typical range: $3k–$8k, depending on complexity.

If this resonates, DM with a short description of what you’re building and where you feel uncertainty.
If it’s not a fit, I’ll say so quickly and honestly.
