# Substack Publishing on Continuum

Many authors use both Substack and Nostr.


1. Continuum Example Running Locally on my Mac

This article exists in three layers:

- Running locally on my machine

- Archived at a deterministic URL

- Stored as a signed Nostr event (kind:30023)

Relay coverage: 5 / 34
Full export layer: PDF, Word, Markdown, HTML.

Same object. Same event ID.

Continuum treats Nostr content as durable infrastructure — not feed entries.

2. Example: Continuum → Substack Workflow

Here’s a real example using a recent article "Building Continuum – Chap. 1."

Published locally in Continuum

After signing + publishing, the article is:

• Stored in my local archive
• Verifiable by event ID
• Relay status visible
• Exportable in multiple formats

Continuum is the source of truth.

Viewing the encrypted / paid link

Paid articles are encrypted at the event level.

Access is controlled via unlock code — not platform account state.

That means:

• The content exists independently
• Payment gates are optional overlays
• I control the distribution logic

Rich Text Export (Substack-ready)

One click → Rich Text (Substack format).

No rewriting.
No formatting gymnastics.
No platform lock-in.

Copy → Paste → Publish.

Same Article on Substack (Paid)

Substack becomes a distribution surface.


But it is not the origin.

The article began as:

• A locally signed event
• In my own archive
• Under my key

That distinction matters.

Continuum = authorship layer
Substack = optional distribution layer

Closing Thoughts

I’m increasingly convinced that authors benefit from having an origin layer that exists independently of any single platform.

For me, that means:

• Writing locally
• Signing with my key
• Archiving automatically
• Then optionally syndicating elsewhere

Substack is a powerful distribution channel.
But it doesn’t have to be the source of truth.

Optionality reduces fragility.

That’s what I’m building toward.
