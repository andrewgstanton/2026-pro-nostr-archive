  "content": "# Continuum  - Local First Publishing - 2/3/2026\n\nI recorded a raw walkthrough of how I actually use Continuum day to day.\n\nIt’s not a polished demo — it’s just me using the app locally and showing how drafting and publishing work in practice.\n\nIf you’ve been wondering what I mean by “local-first,” this shows it better than I can explain in text.\n\nhttps://is.gd/p4fTzm",
