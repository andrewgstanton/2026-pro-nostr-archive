# Continuum  - Local First Publishing - 2/3/2026

I recorded a raw walkthrough of how I actually use Continuum day to day.

It’s not a polished demo — it’s just me using the app locally and showing how drafting and publishing work in practice.

If you’ve been wondering what I mean by “local-first,” this shows it better than I can explain in text.
