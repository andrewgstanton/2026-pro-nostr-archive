# Note 5 - 2/4/2026 - Not Everything That Scales Is Good

Scale without accountability creates distance. Distance erodes truth.

  
Some things *should not* scale:

* trust  
* authorship  
* responsibility  

High-signal systems are intentionally narrow.

> “Signal prefers small rooms.”

Jesus didn’t build a platform.  
He built disciples.

> “Whoever is faithful in very little is also faithful in much.”  
— Luke 16:10
