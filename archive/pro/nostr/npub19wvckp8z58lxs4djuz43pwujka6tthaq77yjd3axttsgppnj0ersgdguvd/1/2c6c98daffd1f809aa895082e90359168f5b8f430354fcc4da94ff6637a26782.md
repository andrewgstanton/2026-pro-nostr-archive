3️⃣ Freedom Is Freedom From Corruption - 2/24/2026

📖 2 Peter 2:19

“They promise them freedom, but they themselves are slaves of corruption. For whatever overcomes a person, to that he is enslaved.”

Not everything that markets itself as liberation actually liberates.

Peter warns about false teachers who promise “freedom” while being mastered by their own desires.

If something masters you — approval, money, anger, ambition — it is not freedom.

Biblical freedom reduces masters to One.
