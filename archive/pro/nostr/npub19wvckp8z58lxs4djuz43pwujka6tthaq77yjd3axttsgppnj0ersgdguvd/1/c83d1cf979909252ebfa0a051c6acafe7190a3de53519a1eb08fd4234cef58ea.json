  "content": "# Short Architecture & Risk Reviews\n\nMost teams don’t fail from lack of talent.\nThey fail when hidden constraints surface too late.\n\nI offer short, fixed-scope architecture & risk reviews for teams building complex systems — especially around identity, data ownership, AI, and long-term durability.\n\nWhat this is:\n• a 2–3 week, time-boxed review\n• architecture, identity, data, AI risk, failure modes\n• written assessment + concrete recommendations\n\nWhat this is not:\n• not a rewrite\n• not staff augmentation\n• not an open-ended advisory role\n\nFixed scope. Fixed timeline. Clear start and end.\nTypical range: $3k–$8k, depending on complexity.\n\nIf this resonates, DM with a short description of what you’re building and where you feel uncertainty.\nIf it’s not a fit, I’ll say so quickly and honestly.\n\n#architecture #risk #builders #ai #identity #sovereignty",
