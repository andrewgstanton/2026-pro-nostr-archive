# 📌 Milestone: Continuum now runs from a USB

Today I crossed an important threshold with Continuum.

I can eject a USB stick, reinsert it, open a terminal, run a single command — and Continuum starts.
No rebuild. No cloud dependency. No prior state required.

The application image lives on the USB.
The data lives on the USB.
The system boots from cold and runs deterministically.

This wasn’t about Docker per se. It was about proving something more fundamental:

A tool should still work when the network, the account system, and the vendor are gone.

Along the way, I ran into exactly the kind of friction that motivated Continuum in the first place:

gated installers

version lockouts

account pressure

disappearing artifacts

“just sign in” assumptions baked into tooling

None of that is dramatic. It’s just structural. And once tools stop being local-first, everything becomes conditional.

Continuum takes the opposite posture:

artifacts over accounts

local state over remote permission

verification over trust

offline as a first-class mode, not an error state

This milestone doesn’t mean Continuum is “finished.”
It means the foundation is solid.

From here on out, whatever gets built on top of it inherits something important:

It still works when you’re not allowed to ask.

That’s the point.
