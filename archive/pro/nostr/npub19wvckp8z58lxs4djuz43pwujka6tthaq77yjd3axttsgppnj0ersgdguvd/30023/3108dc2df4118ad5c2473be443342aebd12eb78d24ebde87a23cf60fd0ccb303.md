There’s a quiet tension many creators live with but rarely talk about.

We use big platforms every day. We post there. We share there. Sometimes we even enjoy it there. And yet, somewhere in the background, there’s a low-grade discomfort — a sense that the things we’re making don’t quite belong to us in the way they should.

This often leads to an all-or-nothing framing:  
Either you fully embrace the platform, or you burn the boats and leave.

But that framing isn’t very helpful. And for most people, it isn’t very realistic.

There’s a middle path that looks much less dramatic, but works surprisingly well over time.

Think of YouTube cooking videos.

A cooking channel might disappear tomorrow. Algorithms change. Accounts get flagged. Platforms rise and fall. But the recipes? Those don’t have to disappear with the channel.

The video is the performance.  
The recipe is the substance.

Good cooks know this instinctively. They keep notebooks. They write things down. They test and refine outside the spotlight. The platform is where the dish is shown — not where the knowledge lives.

Building this way doesn’t require quitting anything.

It just requires a small mental shift: separating *where something is shared* from *where it’s kept*.

You can publish essays on a large platform and still write them first in your own files. You can share photos widely while keeping originals organized locally. You can participate fully without letting participation be the only place your work exists.

This isn’t about purity. It’s about architecture.

Using a shared tool doesn’t mean you’ve surrendered ownership. It just means you’re being practical about distribution.

Nobody accuses a chef of selling out because they didn’t build their own stove.

The quiet work happens offstage.  
The platform is just where the lights are.

And when you build this way, something subtle but important changes. You stop feeling anxious about every update or policy shift. You stop wondering whether your work will vanish one day. You know where it lives.

You don’t have to leave the city to stop building only for it.

You just have to keep your own copies.
