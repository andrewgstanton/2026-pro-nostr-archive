**Goal:** Safely migrate data out of Dropbox into a verifiable, long-term archive stored on Google Drive (or another external location).

This process ensures data integrity, removes cloud-sync side effects, and creates a durable archive you can trust years later.

## Steps

### 1. Sync the folder to a staging location
- Allow Dropbox to fully sync the folder to a local staging area (e.g. `DataBackup2`)
- Confirm sync is complete (green checkmark)

---

### 2. Copy the folder outside Dropbox
- Create a neutral folder **not managed by Dropbox** (e.g. `Transfers`)
- Copy the folder from Dropbox into this location

---

### 3. Verify the copied folder matches the original
- Confirm basic parity:
  - same folder size
  - same number of files
- (Optional) Use Finder “Get Info” or `ls | wc -l`

---

### 4. Create a ZIP archive (via Terminal)
Run from the parent directory of the copied folder:

```
zip -r Archived-FolderName.zip Archived-FolderName
```

- Using Terminal avoids Finder permission and metadata issues.

---

### 5. Verify the ZIP archive

```
unzip -t Archived-FolderName.zip
```

Proceed only if you see:

```
No errors detected in compressed data
```

---

### 6. Generate a checksum

Create a SHA-256 checksum and save it alongside the ZIP:

```
shasum -a 256 Archived-FolderName.zip > Archived-FolderName.zip.sha256
```

This file is your long-term integrity anchor.

---

### 7. Copy archive to long-term storage

Upload both files:

- Archived-FolderName.zip

- Archived-FolderName.zip.sha256

- Destination: Google Drive, external HDD, or cold storage.

---

### 8. Clean up

Once upload completes successfully, delete:

= the original Dropbox folder
= the copied working folder
- the local ZIP (optional, if Drive is your source of truth)
