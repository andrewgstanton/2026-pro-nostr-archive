Only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another.”\n\nFreedom is not isolation.\n\nPaul moves immediately from liberty to service.\n\nThe pattern is:\n\nFreed from sin\n\nFreed from condemnation\n\nFreed from fear\n\nTherefore free to love\n\nFreedom that does not produce love is not the freedom Paul describes.",
