We don’t rush this.

We move in layers.

##cPhase 1 — Full Manuscript Structural Walkthrough (2–3 days)

We will:

Read Part I–V for tonal consistency

Remove repetition (you have some recurring phrases)

Tighten metaphors

Normalize terminology (custody / leverage / authority / architecture)

Check rule consistency across chapters

Verify emotional arc escalation

Smooth transitions between chapters

This is not rewriting.

This is sharpening.

## Phase 2 — Line Editing Pass

We’ll look for:

Sentence rhythm

Repeated constructions

Overuse of certain phrases (“authority,” “leverage,” “local-first”)

Paragraph length variation

Flow between sections

We want:

Serious.
Clean.
Tight.
Durable.

Not verbose.

## Phase 3 — Formatting for KDP

You’ll need:

1️⃣ Trim Size Decision (Paperback)

Most likely:

6 x 9 inches (standard nonfiction)

Cream paper

Matte cover

This fits the tone of the book.

2️⃣ Kindle Formatting

We’ll:

Remove excess line spacing

Normalize headings (H1 for chapters, H2 for subheads)

Ensure no weird markdown artifacts

Prepare clean DOCX or EPUB

3️⃣ Front Matter

We’ll add:

Title page

Copyright page

Dedication (optional)

Epigraph (optional)

About the Author

About Continuum Press

4️⃣ Back Matter

A short Continuum description

Website / Nostr identity

Call to build (not call to buy)

## Phase 4 — Cover Strategy

This is important.

Given tone, I strongly suggest:

Minimalist.
Architectural.
Not flashy.

Possibly:

Dark background

Clean serif title

Subtitle small

“Continuum Press” imprint mark at bottom

No tech cliché imagery.

No glowing circuits.

No blockchain icons.

## Phase 5 — Hardcover?

Yes.

Here’s why:

This book reads like something that should exist physically.

Hardcover signals durability.

And this is a book about durability.

Even if hardcover sales are low, it aligns with the message.

Practical Questions For You

Do you want to publish under your legal name only?

Do you want “Continuum Press” on the spine?

Do you want a subtitle? (Example: Architecture, Custody, and Freedom in the Digital Age)

Approximate word count?

Do you want Scripture references subtly in front/back matter given your conviction?
